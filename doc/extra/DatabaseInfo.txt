===Database information

== Overview 

SRDR is using a SQLite database in development and a PostgreSQL database in the production system (on heroku).

The default development database type in Ruby on Rails is a SQLite database, which is a single database file. It can be viewed using a SQLite database viewer application on Windows, Mac OS, or Linux.

The development site (srdr-dev), and all default free Heroku applications, use a shared database. The production site (srdr.heroku.com) uses a for-pay dedicated database. From the heroku page, as of 5/12/2011:

The shared plan is suitable for development and staging applications. It runs PostgreSQL 8.3. The dedicated plans are suitable for production scale applications. In addition, the dedicated databases offer a number of advantages, including direct access (via psql or any native postgresql library), stored procedures, and PostgreSQL 9 support.
