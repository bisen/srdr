== Technical questions for AHRQ

Last updated 1-5-2012

- What does "Instructional Text Needs to be marked up" mean?
Example:  on the study form page (../studies/new), "Instructional text needs to be marked up" was listed for the following code: 
  <form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/search/results" id="searchform" method="get">
  <div style="margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt; display: inline;"&gt;<input nam.....

- AHRQ spacer being interpreted as placeholder text
Example: On all pages with the AHRQ footer (all pages), "Suspicious text equivalent for Image - could be placeholder text or ascii art" was listed for the following code:  
  <img alt="Spacer" class="ftrimgctr" src="/images/ahrq/space.gif?1324669924">

- AHRQ footer links don’t include a "skip navigation" link
Example:  Example: On all pages with the AHRQ footer, "Mechanism to bypass navigation links is absent" was listed for the following code:
  <a href="/">AHRQ Home</a> | <a href="https://info.ahrq.gov/cgi-bin/
  ahrq.cfg/php/enduser/std_alp.php">Questions?</a> | <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/inf...

- Ask if storing a session for a certain time is acceptable (user login session times out after a certain amount of time)
- Ask if we are required to provide shortcut keys for certain sections (i.e. Search)

== Policy questions for AHRQ

- List what personally identifiable information we are storing (name, email address, organization, password) and ask if storing that info complies with OMB/AHRQ policy
- Ask whether we need a Privacy Impact Assessment based on the final registration model
- Ask if there are any OMB/AHRQ policy issues with our recordkeeping policy (records will be stored indefinitely)
- Ask whether password protection must happen while hosted on Heroku, or if it can be after the site is ported to AHRQ
- Ask about the possibility and process of obtaining an "srdr.ahrq.gov" domain name
- Send Biff of our definition of "Wiki" (commenting system) and ask whether this complies with OMB/AHRQ policy
- Ask what we need to do for the final approval process (what the submission process is, what documentation we need)
