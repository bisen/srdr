<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The traditional process for systematic review projects involves creating an
extraction form to serve as a template for guiding the data extraction.
Upon form completion, researchers manually scan journal articles one at a
time and parse out any pertinent information requested in the extraction
form. The ability to easily combine findings from multiple studies will be
dependent on the quality of extraction form used, making it crucial and
worthwhile to spend time developing a high quality form.
</p>
<p>
Digitization of the extraction form creation process is one of the many
goals of the SRDR system, but the amount of variation between projects and
between studies has made the design stages for this feature especially
challenging. The solution to this problem has come not as one main idea,
but as a collection of ideas and methods tailored to the needs of specific
extraction form sections. Among these solutions is the question builder
functionality that is party of the Design Details and Baseline
Characteristics sections of the site.
</p>
<p>
Question Builder allows the project lead to define questions and answer
choices for data fields associated with either the design details or
baseline characteristics data elements. Answer choices can be represented
as a radio buttons, check boxes, dropdown boxes or as a simple text entry,
adding a great deal of flexibility to the extraction form. Researchers
carrying out data extraction will then see each question for their
associated studies and can input answers appropriately using the method
specified in the extraction form.
</p>
<p>
In order to assure reusability of code, the question builder feature was
developed to be fairly generic and to work for multiple data models. A
single QuestionBuilder controller handles the majority of functionality and
logic, including adding or removing question choices, removing or editing
existing questions and question choices and re-ordering questions after
creation. View partials in the views/question_builder directory are used in
AJAX calls between the server and controller functions. To make this work
for various database models, an instance variable named @model passes
information into the question_builder partials.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing the only prerequisite for using question builder is
to set up the database tables accordingly. For a given model known as
&#8220;test_model&#8221;, the system should have the following controllers,
database tables and models defined:
</p>
<h3>Required controllers for test_model:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
test_model_controller.rb
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
test_model_fields_controller.rb
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
test_model_data_points_controller.rb
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Database tables are also set up to correspond with these controllers:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
test_models
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
test_model_fields
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
test_model_data_points
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>To communicate with the tables above, models are also created:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
test_model.rb
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
test_model_field.rb
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
test_model_data_points.rb  
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To replicate the existing system for a new data model, test_model_field.rb
should contain a function for saving question choices, while
test_model_data_point.rb should contain a function for saving the extracted
answers to the defined questions. In accordance with these controllers,
models and database tables, the aforementioned @model variable would then
need to contain the value ?test_model? whenever the question_builder
interface is being used. This value would be passed into the question
builder, and all fields/buttons would be set to automatically communicate
with the corresponding database tables.
</p>
<p>
To see an example of the question builder setup, refer to the baseline
characteristics extraction form and study sections. Below is a basic
outline of the files which will contain additional AJAX calls to the
question builder controller code.
</p>
<h2>In Extraction Form Creation</h2>
<p>
/app/views/extraction_forms/baselines.html.erb
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
renders a form for a BaselineCharacteristic object found in the partial,
/app/views/baseline_characteristic_fields/_form.html.erb
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
upon form submission the create function in the
app/controllers/baseline_characteristic_controller.rb is called
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
makes a call to save_question_choices in the BaselineCharacteristicField
model
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
updates preview partial with
/app/views/question_builder/_extraction_form_preview.html.erb
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
resets the question builder form with baseline_characteristic_fields/form
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>In Study Extraction</h2>
<p>
/app/views/studies/baselines.html.erb
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
renders a form for a BaselineCharacteristicDataPoint object in
app/views/baseline_characteristic_data_points/table.html.erb.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
upon form submission the create function in the
app/controllers/baseline_characteristic_data_point_controller.rb is called
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
makes a call to save_data in the BaselineCharacteristicDataPoint model
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
AJAX call shows an indication of save success
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is quite possible that this code could be cleaned up in future versions
of SRDR. Until then, questions regarding how to use this setup may be
directed to cparkin@tuftsmedicalcenter.edu.
