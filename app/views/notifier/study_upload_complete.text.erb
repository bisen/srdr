		However, we wanted to make you aware of the following warnings that came up:
		<% @warning_lines.each do |w| %>
			<%= "Line #{w[0]}: #{w[1]}\r\n" %>
		<% end %>
	<% end %>
<% else %>
We experienced problems while attempting to create some of the studies in your list.

# Submitted: <%= @num_successful + @problem_lines.length %>
# Created: <%= @num_successful %>

Studies found on the following lines of the uploaded file could not be created:
	<%= @problem_lines.each do |p| %>
	<%= "Line #{p[0]}: #{p[1]}\r\n" %>
	<% end %>

	<% unless @warning_lines.empty? %>
	In addition, the following warnings were generated:
	<% @warning_lines.each do |w| %>
		<%= "Line #{w[0]}: #{w[1]}\r\n" %>
	<% end %>
