<h2>Introduction</h2><br/><br/>
<a name="intro1"></a><div style='float:right;'><a href='#top'>Back to Top</a></div>
<h3>What is the SRDR?</h3>
<br/>
The Systematic Review Data Repository (SRDR) is a Web-based tool for the extraction and management of data for systematic review or meta-analysis. It is also an open and searchable archive of systematic reviews and their data. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>With the SRDR you can:</strong>
<ul class='normal_list'>
<li>Create flexible extraction forms for use by your research team</li>
<li>Manage team members and their privileges</li>
<li>View, validate and analyze data extracted for your systematic review project</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<strong>Forthcoming:</strong>
<ul class='normal_list'>
<li>Easily import data from previous reviews or extracted with other software, for simplified search and management</li>
<li>Search for, view, and download all archived reviews, data, and extraction forms</li>
</ul>
The SRDR was designed and implemented by the Tufts Evidence-based Practice Center with funding from the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality. Its goal is to reduce the burden of conducting systematic reviews by encouraging researchers to contribute data to a shared archive, allowing the wider scientific community to easily find, evaluate, and repurpose data in future research. The online software application component of the SRDR serves as the interface for this database as well as a compelling option for organizing and carrying out systematic review projects.
<br/><br/>
<a name="intro2"></a><div style='float:right;'><a href='#top'>Back to Top</a></div>
<h3>User Manual Goals</h3>
<br/>
The purpose of this manual is to familiarize users with the SRDR software and archive, and to provide step-by-step instructions for all of the most common SRDR tasks. Specifically, users will be instructed how to:
<br/><ul class='normal_list'>
<li>Create and edit systematic review projects</li>
<li>Add users to projects and adjust user privileges</li>
<li>Create and edit extraction forms</li>
<li>Use an extraction form to enter data into a systematic review project</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<!--This section provides a brief overview of the general conventions of the user manual as well as the SRDR Web site, including basic terminology, how to navigate your workspace, the typical workflow and lifecycle of an SRDR project, and how to access the system's online help resources.<br/><br/>-->
<a name="intro3"></a><div style='float:right;'><a href='#top'>Back to Top</a></div>
<h3>SRDR Overview</h3>
All data within the SRDR are organized into projects. Projects are self-contained and comprise all information related to an individual systematic review. Among this information are the central research queries the project is intended to address, called key questions. At least one key question must be defined for any project. Projects further contain sub-elements called studies and extraction forms. Extraction forms are the dialogs by which users extract data from publications into an SRDR project. A study, as defined within the SRDR, represents an individual extracted publication (one filled in extraction form).  

<ul class='normal_list'>
	<li>
		Project: All data deposited within the SRDR are organized as individual projects. A project contains all information related to one systematic review (e.g., extraction forms, key questions, extracted studies, etc.).
	</li>
	<li>
		Key Question(s): The specific scientific queries an SRDR project is intended to address. All projects must include at least one key question.
	</li>
	<li>
		Extraction Form: The user-defined dialogue by which collaborators extract data from relevant publications into an SRDR project.
	</li>
	<li>
		Study: An individual publication extraction, consisting of one instance of a filled out extraction form.  
 	</li>
 </ul>

<br/>
Access to projects and certain elements of project functionality are restricted based on the user's role within a project (either lead or collaborator).  When a new project is created, the creator is automatically designated as lead.  The lead can add collaborators or designate new leads or collaborators (see Add/Edit Users and User Roles under How To for instructions).  Only leads may create extraction forms or manage users.  Collaborators may only use extraction forms to extract data into a project.
<br/><br/>
The general life-cycle of an SRDR project begins with its initial creation and then proceeds through the definition of the project's key question(s), design of one or more extraction forms, addition/extraction of one or more studies, and finally review and publication. "Publication" denotes a project's formal deposition into the SRDR, and the point at which it and its data become publically accessible.

<a name='how8'></a>
<h3>Assign Studies in SRDR to Project Team Members</h3>
<br/>
It is possible to assign study records to individual members of your project team, but you must have project lead status in the project to do so. 
<br/>
<br/>
<h4>Step 1: Preparing a Study Citation and User Assignment Import Form</h4>
<br/>
Sample Files and instructions for preparing a Study Citation and User Assignment Import Form are available to download from the Add a New Study Page of SRDR, accessible by navigating to the <strong>Lead Role</strong> tab in the MySRDR page (use the MySRDR link at the top of the page) and clicking the <strong>Add a Study</strong> link below the project you would like to modify; Or alternatively, if you are already within the desired project, click on <strong>Add a New Study</strong> under <strong>Project Study Data</strong> in the left-hand navigation/action menu. On the following page, select <strong>Upload a file of study citations and user assignments</strong>.
<br/><br/>
While preparing your assignment import form, it is important to keep in mind that the column headers on your import form must exactly match the column headers seen in the Study Citations and User Assignment Sample Files.
<br/>
Furthermore:
<ul class='normal_list'>
	<li>Project team members listed in the <strong>SRDR_Username</strong> column must be identified by their SRDR user names. Email addresses are not accepted by the SRDR system. </li>
	<li>You can choose to add PubMed IDs or full PubMed study citation information to your import form. If you choose to include the PubMed IDs of studies on you import form, then SRDR will auto-populate publication information for each study based on the supplied PubMed ID. </li>
	<li>The addition of KQs to your import form is optional. </li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<h4> Step 2: Uploading the Study Citation and User Assignment Import Form to your Project</h4>
<br/>
Having saved your import form as a tab delimited (.txt) file, you may now upload it to the SRDR system.
<br/>
<ol class='normal_ordered_list'> <li>From the SRDR home page, log into your profile using your SRDR username and password. </li>
<li>Once you are logged in, check that you are in the MySRDR tab.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Add a Study</strong> link under the project to which you would like to add the studies. You will be directed to the Add a Study page where you are given 3 options to add a study to your project.</li>
<li>Select the third option: <strong>Upload a file of study citations and user assignments</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Browse button</strong>.</li>
<li>Select your saved import form.</li>
<li>The file name will appear in the field next to the Browse button.</li>
	<ol class='normal_lettered_list'>
		<li>As mentioned in Step 1, below the Browse button are links to example import forms you can download and use as templates for your own import forms.</li>  
	</ol>
</li>
<li>Click <strong>Upload</strong>.</li>
<li>On the following page, you will be presented with a confirmation banner notifying you that SRDR has begun to add the study citations and user assignments you listed on the import form into your project. SRDR will continue this task in the background.</li>
<li>Once the task is completed, the studies you have added to your project will appear in your project’s study list and you will receive a notification email.</li>
