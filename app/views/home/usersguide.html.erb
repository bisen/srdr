It is also an open and searchable archive of systematic reviews and their data. With the SRDR you can:<p/>&nbsp;<p/>&nbsp;<li> Create flexible extraction forms for use by your research team<li> Manage team members and their privileges<li> View, validate and analyze data extracted for your systematic review projectForthcoming: <li> Easily import data from previous reviews or extracted with other software, for simplified search and management<li> Search for, view, and download all archived reviews, data, and extraction forms<p/>&nbsp;<p/>&nbsp;The SRDR was designed and implemented by the Tufts Evidence-based Practice Center with funding from the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality. Its goal is to reduce the burden of conducting systematic reviews by encouraging researchers to contribute data to a shared archive, allowing the wider scientific community to easily find, evaluate, and repurpose these data in future research. The online software application component of the SRDR serves as the interface for this database as well as a compelling option for organizing and carrying out systematic review projects.User Manual Goals <p/>&nbsp;<p/>&nbsp;The purpose of this manual is to familiarize users with the SRDR software and archive, and to provide step-by-step instructions for all of the most common SRDR tasks. Specifically, users will be instructed how to:<p/>&nbsp;<p/>&nbsp;<li> Create and edit systematic review projects<li> Add users to projects and adjust user privileges<li> Create and edit extraction forms<li> Use an extraction form to enter data into a systematic review project<p/>&nbsp;<p/>&nbsp;<p/>&nbsp;<hr width="100%"><p/>&nbsp;<p/>&nbsp;<a name="gettingstarted"><div class="document_title">Getting Started</div><br/><p/>&nbsp;<p/>&nbsp;This section provides a brief overview of the general conventions of the user manual as well as the SRDR Web site, including basic terminology, how to navigate your workspace, the typical workflow and lifecycle of an SRDR project, and how to access the system?s online help resources.<p/>&nbsp;<p/>&nbsp;<div class="document_title">SRDR Overview</div><p/>&nbsp;<p/>&nbsp;All data within the SRDR are organized into projects. Projects are self-contained and comprise all information related to an individual systematic review. Among this information are the central research queries the project is intended to address, called key questions. At least one key question must be defined for any project. Projects further contain sub-elements called studies and extraction forms. Extraction forms are the dialogs by which users extract data from publications into an SRDR project. A study, as defined within the SRDR, represents an individual extracted publication (one filled in extraction form).  <p/>&nbsp;<p/>&nbsp;<li> Project: All data deposited within the SRDR are organized as individual projects. A project contains all information related to one systematic review (e.g., extraction forms, key questions, extracted studies, etc.).<li> Key Question(s): The specific scientific queries an SRDR project is intended to address. All projects must include at least one key question.<li> Extraction Form: The user-defined dialogue by which collaborators extract data from relevant publications into an SRDR project.<li> Study: An individual publication extraction, consisting of one instance of a filled out extraction form.  <p/>&nbsp;<p/>&nbsp;<img alt="Figure 1: SRDR Overview" src="/images/usersguide/figure1.png" border="0"<br/><p/>&nbsp;<div class="document_figure">Figure 1. SRDR Overview</div> <p/>&nbsp;<p/>&nbsp;Access to projects and certain elements of project functionality are restricted based on the user?s role within a project (either lead or collaborator).  When a new project is created, the creator is automatically designated as lead.  The lead can add collaborators or designate new leads or collaborators (see Add/Edit Users and User Roles under How To for instructions).  Only leads may create extraction forms or manage users.  Collaborators may only use extraction forms to extract data into a project.<p/>&nbsp;<p/>&nbsp;The general life-cycle of an SRDR project begins with its initial creation and then proceeds through the definition of the project?s key question(s),     design of one or more extraction forms, addition/extraction of one or more studies, and finally review and publication. ?Publication? denotes a project?s formal deposition into the SRDR, and the point at which it and its data become publically accessible.<p/>&nbsp;<p/>&nbsp;<img alt="Figure 2: The Project Life Cycle" src="/images/usersguide/figure2.png" border="0"<br/><p/>&nbsp;<div class="document_figure">Figure 2.
