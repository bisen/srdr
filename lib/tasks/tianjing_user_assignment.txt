Comparison of intraocular pressure lowering effect of once daily morning vs evening dosing of latanoprost/timolol maleate combination	 	"European Journal of Ophthalmology.18(1)(pp 60-65), 2008.Date of Publication: Jan 2008."	 	 	 	 	 	"PURPOSE. TO compare intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction profiles of latanoprost-timolol maleate fixed combination (LTFC) administered in the morning or evening in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). METHODS. A prospective, randomized study including 60 eyes of 30 patients with POAG was carried out. Patients were randomized to treatment with LTFC at 8 PM (Group 1) or at 8 AM (Group 2). After therapy of 4 weeks, IOP was measured at 2 AM, 6 AM, 10 AM, 2 PM, 6 PM, and 10 PM and compared with baseline values and latanoprost therapy alone. RESULTS. Mean diurnal baseline IOPs and IOPs after treatment with latanoprost and LTFC were 23.6+/-2.6, 16.7+/-2.3, and 15.5+/-2.2 mmHg in Group 1 and 23.1 +/-2.6, 16.9+/-2.4, and 15.7+2.4 mmHg in Group 2. LTFC lowered IOP more than latanoprost at all time points in both groups (p0.05). According to IOP reduction from baseline, there was a statistically significant difference between groups in favor of Group 1 at 6 AM, 10 AM, and mean diurnal measurement (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS. Both morning and evening dosing of LTFC were effective in lowering diurnal IOP in patients with POAG. However, evening dosing of LTFC seemed to be more effective in controlling IOP especially in the morning and avoiding the fluctuations with lower range of IOP. copyright Wichtig Editore, 2008."

Efficacy and side effects of latanoprost monotherapy compared to adding dorzolamide to timolol in patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension - A three-month randomised study	European journal of ophthalmology	Eur.J.Ophthalmol.	2000	10	3	198	204	"Purpose. To compare the efficacy and safety of latanoprost monotherapy or dorzolamide and timolol in glaucoma patients inadequately controlled on adrenergic beta-receptor antagonist therapy. Methods. A total of 164 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, capsular glaucoma or ocular hypertension were included in a three-month, open-label, randomised multicentre study. Patients with open-angle glaucoma were required to have IOP at least 22 mmHg and patients with ocular hypertension were required to have IOP at least 27 mmHg, on treatment with one or two ocular hypotensive drugs of which at least one had to be a beta-blocker. All patients were treated with timolol, 5 mg/ml twice daily, for a 2-4 week run-in period. They were then randomised to latanoprost, 50 mug/ml once daily, or timolol 5 mg/ml plus dorzolamide, 20 mg/ml twice daily. The difference in mean diurnal IOP change from baseline to month 3 was compared in the two groups. Results. When patients were switched to latanoprost, mean diurnal IOP was reduced by 5.2 mmHg (23%) compared to 4.0 mmHg (17%) in the group in which dorzolamide was added to timolol. The difference of 1.2 mmHg was statistically significant (p = 0.005). The majority of adverse events during both treatments were judged as mild. Conclusions. The results suggest that a switch to latanoprost monotherapy is an alternative to combined treatment with timolol and dorzolamide in patients inadequately controlled on a topical adrenergic beta-receptor antagonist alone.

The Brimonidine Study Group III	Survey of ophthalmology	Surv.Ophthalmol.	1996	41 Suppl 1	 	S39	47	"The safety and ocular hypotensive efficacy of twice-daily administration of brimonidine 0.2% solution or betaxolol 0.25% suspension were compared in subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. A total of 206 adult patients were enrolled in a prospective, 3-month, multicentered, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group study. Both drugs significantly (p < 0.001) reduced peak and trough intraocular pressure (IOP) at every scheduled follow-up visit over the 3-month study. At peak, the overall mean decrease from baseline IOP was greater (p = 0.004) in the brimonidine-treated group (5.8 mm Hg) than in the betaxolol-treated group (3.8 mm Hg). At trough, the overall mean decrease from baseline (p < 0.001) was 3.9 mm Hg in the brimonidine-treated group and 3.2 mm Hg in the betaxolol-treated group. The IOP-lowering effect of brimonidine was sustained throughout the 3-month study period. Terminations from the study due to lack of efficacy included 2.9% (3/103) of patients in the brimonidine group and 4.2% (4/96) of those in the betaxolol group. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups, with the only significant (p = 0.027) between-group difference being that ocular blurring was reported more often by patients receiving betaxolol suspension than by those receiving brimonidine treatment. Instillation of drug was reported to be comfortable (p = 0.036) by more brimonidine-treated patients than betaxolol-treated patients. Overall, brimonidine 0.2% solution was well-tolerated, safe and clinically and statistically more effective than betaxolol 0.25% suspension in lowering intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension."

"Purpose: To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect of concomitant administration of 0.5% timolol and 2% dorzolamide and a fixed combination dorzolamide-timolol (Cosopt). To critically evaluate discrepancies between phase 3 clinical trials and prior replacement studies. Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial and a prospective, non-randomized comparative replacement trial. Participants/interventions: In a national multicentre trial, 131 patients were randomized to dorzolamide-timolol or a topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (CAI) and non-selective beta-blocker following a 1-month run-in using the separate components. Peak (maximal drug effect) and trough (minimal drug effect) IOPs were measured at baseline and 1 month after treatment. The replacement therapy study enrolled 404 consecutive glaucoma patients using a non-selective beta-blocker and dorzolamide and changed treatment to the fixed combination. Mean IOPs at the same time of day were compared before and 1 month after changeover. Main outcome measure: The main outcome measure was IOP, comparing baseline and on-therapy measurements at study conclusion between the two arms of the randomized trial and before and after switching therapy in the replacement trial. Results: In the randomized trial, the mean base-line peak and trough IOPs were 18.4 and 21.0 mmHg in the group randomized to combination therapy and 17.6 and 19.8 mmHg in the dual drug group. After randomization and treatment for four weeks, the peak and trough IOPs were 17.6 and 19.5 mmHg in the combination group and 17.3 and 19.0 mmHg in the concomitant group. The percentage change in IOP was -3.2% at peak and -6.5% at trough for the combination and -0.3 and -3.2% for the concomitant group. These differences did not show statistical significance. In the replacement study, mean baseline IOP was 19.4 mmHg. Four weeks after initiation of treatment on the fixed combination, a significant additional IOP reduction of 1.7 mmHg (-8.8%) was observed (P < 0.0001). Overall, 81% of eyes exhibited equal or lower IOP on the fixed combination compared with concomitant therapy. Conclusion: The results of the randomized trial indicate that the fixed combination dorzolamide-timolol (Cosopt) was as effective as its components in controlling IOP, confirming results seen in phase 3 clinical trials. However, in the replacement study, utilization of the combination drug offered a statistically significant additional IOP reduction (P < 0.0001), which duplicates results from previous replacement studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized, open label, crossover, two period comparative study. At the baseline visit, subjects were randomized to two groups. Group A received Xalatan for weeks 1-12 followed by Latoprost for weeks 13-24. Group B received Latoprost for weeks 1-12 followed by Xalatan for weeks 13-24. RESULTS: 30 subjects were recruited, 12 in Group A and 18 in Group B. In subjects administered Xalatan, intraocular pressure (IOP) showed a greater decrease (P < 0.001) from 23.64 +/- 3.13 mmHg at baseline to 14.29 +/- 1.61 mmHg at week 12 (fall of 9.35 +/- 3.55 mmHg, 38.66% +/- 10.29) than that seen in the Latoprost group (22.74 +/- 2.47 mmHg to 16.98 +/- 2.49 mmHg, fall of 5.76 +/- 1.41 mmHg; 25.42% +/- 5.98). In period 2 when subjects were crossed over to Xalatan from Latoprost, there was a further fall from 16.98 +/- 2.49 mmHg to 16.09 +/- 1.49 at week 24 (fall of 0.89 +/- 1.59 mmHg; 4.3% +/- 8.76). However, when subjects were crossed over to Latoprost from Xalatan, the IOP rose from 14.29 +/- 1.61 mmHg to 15.36 +/- 1.71 mmHg at week 24 (8.86% +/- 17.76). There was no significant difference in incidence of conjunctival hyperemia or any other adverse events in both the groups. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of IOP lowering in patients with POAG and OH with Xalatan and Latoprost is different. In our study, the IOP lowering with Xalatan was higher than that with Latoprost.

Design: Randomized, open, crossover single-center study. Participants: Twenty-seven patients with ocular hypertension. Methods: The patients were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of latanoprost 0.005% once daily or timolol gel 0.5% once daily, with a 4-week washout period before switching therapy. Main Outcome Measures: Measurement of IOP during 24 hours of hospitalization. Blood pressure and heart rate were also measured repeatedly over the 24 hours. Daytime mean IOP, nighttime mean IOP, and 24-hour mean IOP were calculated as IOP area under the curve (AUC) divided by time in hours. Results: The mean IOP during daytime (7 AM to 10 PM) was 13.5 +/- 0.4 mmHg (daytime IOP, AUC/15 hours, least square mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) in the latanoprost group, and 14.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg in the timolol gel group. This difference of 1.3 +/- 0.3 mmHg was statistically significant in favor of latanoprost (P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7, 2.0). The mean IOP at night (10 PM to 7 AM) was 13.7 +/- 0.4 mmHg for latanoprost (nighttime IOP, AUC/9 hours, least square mean +/- SEM) and 15.9 +/- 0.5 mmHg for timolol gel, with a difference of 2.2 +/- 0.3 mmHg (P < 0.001; 95% CI, 1.5, 2.8). At every measured time point during the 24 hours, latanoprost reduced IOP more than timolol. There was no difference between the two treatment groups regarding blood pressure and heart rate. Conclusions: Latanoprost reduced mean 24-hour IOP, mean daytime IOP, and mean nighttime IOP statistically significantly more than timolol. Also, latanoprost reduced IOP more effectively at every measured time point over the 24 hours compared with timolol gel. copyright 2001 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology."

Methods: In a 12-month, randomized, double-masked, multicenter, parallel group, non-inferiority study, patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension who were treated with brimonidine-purite 0.15% BID were randomly assigned to continue brimonidine-purite 0.15% (n = 102) or to administer brimonidine-purite 0.1% (n = 105) BID for 12 months. IOP was measured at approximately 8 a.m. (hour 0) and 10 a.m. (hour 2). Main outcome measures: Mean change from baseline IOP and adverse events. Results: Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. Treated-baseline mean IOPs at both timepoints were similar between groups (p [greater-than or equal to] 0.606). Brimonidine-purite 0.1% provided IOP-lowering that was non-inferior to brimonidine-purite 0.15% at each of the 12 follow-up timepoints, and there were no statistically significant between-group differences at any timepoint. The most commonly reported adverse event was conjunctival hyperemia (13.5% for brimonidine-purite 0.1%; 10.8% for brimonidine-purite 0.15%). No significant differences in the incidence of adverse events were noted between the two formulations. Conclusions: Brimonidine-purite 0.1% BID is as effective as brimonidine-purite 0.15% BID in lowering IOP in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension who were previously treated with brimonidine-purite 0.15%, and both formulations are well tolerated. Limitations of the study include enrollment of only patients who were already on treatment with brimonidine-purite 0.15%. The 0.1% formulation of brimonidine-purite allows for decreased exposure to brimonidine while providing an IOP-lowering effect comparable to that of the 0.15% formulation.

Effect of timolol versus pilocarpine on visual field progression in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma	Ophthalmology	Ophthalmology	1992	99	10	1505	1511	"BACKGROUND: Relatively few studies have been conducted linking decreasing intraocular pressure (IOP) to preservation of visual field. This investigation was conducted to determine if this link could be made and to compare the long-term effect of two ocular hypotensive agents on preservation of visual field. METHODS: In an observer-masked study, 189 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma received either timolol or pilocarpine by random allocation. The dose of antiglaucoma agent was increased from 0.25% to 0.5% twice daily for timolol or from 2% to 4% four times daily for pilocarpine if the initial IOP response was inadequate. After an on-treatment baseline, visual fields were followed every 4 months for 2 years using the Octopus program 32. RESULTS: Compared with timolol, significantly more patients receiving pilocarpine discontinued use because of inadequate IOP control (P < or = 0.01). By comparing the mean visual field scores, it can be seen that the pilocarpine group had a significantly worse score at all timepoints from month 4 to month 24. The pilocarpine group also had a greater mean number of test loci with decreased sensitivity of 5 or more decibels (dB) at all timepoints. The mean within-patient regression slope for timolol was 0.01 dB/month and for pilocarpine was -0.06 dB/month (P < 0.01). The study has shown that over a 2-year period, patients treated with pilocarpine 2% or 4% four times daily experienced a significantly greater visual field deterioration than that seen in patients receiving either 0.25% or 0.5% timolol twice daily. CONCLUSION: Although these data do not support a link between lowering of IOP and visual field preservation, treatment with timolol was associated with significantly less visual field loss than treatment with pilocarpine.

Additivity Study Group	Journal of glaucoma	J.Glaucoma	1998	7	4	253	260	"PURPOSE: Two parallel, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies were conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of 2% dorzolamide hydrochloride as adjunctive therapy to 0.5% timolol maleate ophthalmic gellan (gel-forming) solution in patients with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) that was inadequately controlled with 0.5% timolol maleate gellan solution alone. METHODS: Both studies began with an open-label 2-week run-in period on 0.5% timolol maleate gellan solution once a day. The only variation in method between the two studies was the dosage of 2% dorzolamide. In one study, 202 patients received 0.5% timolol maleate gellan solution once daily plus either 2% dorzolamide or placebo three times daily. In the other study, 181 patients received 0.5% timolol maleate gellan solution once daily plus either 2% dorzolamide or placebo twice daily. RESULTS: After 85 days, additional mean percent reductions in IOP from baseline at morning trough for the groups receiving 2% dorzolamide three times daily and placebo three times daily were 12.5% and 8.4%, respectively. Mean percent reductions for the groups receiving 2% dorzolamide twice daily and placebo twice daily were 13.1% and 6.5%, respectively. Burning and/or stinging on instillation were the only adverse experiences that affected significantly more of the patients receiving 2% dorzolamide twice or three times daily than those receiving placebo. CONCLUSION: When administered concomitantly with 0.5% timolol maleate gellan solution, 2% dorzolamide three times daily or twice daily produced a statistically significant reduction in IOP at morning trough and peak and was generally well tolerated."

Their average age was 33 +/- 13 y/o (range 14-45). Under the randomized, double-masked design, one drop of 0.5% timolol maleate was given in one eye, and placebo in the fellow eye. Heart rate, blood pressure, intraocular pressure, and ocular perfusion were measured at baseline, and then 30 minutes and 2 hours after treatment. Ocular perfusion was measured by Heidelberg Retina Flowmeter (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). We used 10 degree measurement field and 10 x 10 pixels measurement frame. Four areas were measured, i.e., temporal upper, temporal lower, and nasal parts of the optic disc, and macula. In comparison to the baseline, the treated eyes had a slight reduction of blood flow, volume, and velocity 30 minutes after treatment, but these parameters came back close to the baseline value at 2 hours after treatment. Similar changes were also noted in the control eyes. The results showed that a single drop of 0.5% timolol had minimal effects on the retinal and macular circulation within 2 hours after treatment."

Influence of betaxolol and timolol on the venous tone in glaucoma patients	International ophthalmology	Int.Ophthalmol.	1999	23	3	149	153	"The aim of this study was the assessment of physiological venous reflexes in 40 glaucoma patients treated with topically applied timolol maleate 0.50% and betaxolol HCL 0.50%. They were divided into two groups of twenty each; one group being given timolol and the other betaxolol. The assessment of the venous tone was performed by testing venous reflexes. We found no statistically significant difference between timolol and betaxolol; however, when the influence of circulating catecholamines and the other vasoactive substances was excluded by suprasphygmatic insufflation of a pediatric cuff, a significant difference was found in the Valsalva's maneuver (125.5 +/- 8.1 vs 85.0 +/- 34.3 venoconstrictive units VCUs, p = 0.03). The IOP was significantly decreased in both treatment group, although the pressure reduction effect was more pronounced in the timolol group. Our study suggests that timolol and betaxolol have a slightly different mode of action on the venous side of circulation under topical medications. It is possible that the use of betaxolol topically may reduce a systemic venoconstriction."

Three-month comparison of brimonidine and latanoprost as adjunctive therapy in glaucoma and ocular hypertension patients uncontrolled on beta-blockers: Tolerance and peak intraocular pressure lowering	Ophthalmology	Ophthalmology	2002	109	2	307	314	"Purpose: To compare the tolerance and peak intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy of brimonidine and latanoprost as adjunctive therapy in patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma uncontrolled on beta-blockers. Design: A prospective, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-design clinical trial. Participants: One hundred fifteen patients with IOP inadequately controlled on topical beta-blocker monotherapy. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive brimonidine, 0.2%, twice a day or latanoprost, 0.005%, every day as adjunctive therapy for 3 months. After 1 month of adjunctive treatment, patients who failed to meet a target 15% reduction in IOP at peak drug effect were crossed over to the other study medication. The target sample size of 51/group gave a power of 0.80 to detect a difference of 1 mmHg in mean IOP lowering between groups. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome variables were reduction in IOP from baseline at peak drug effect, response rate, and quality of life as measured using the Glaucoma Disability Index. Results: Mean beta-blocker-treated baseline IOP was comparable between treatment groups ([similar to]21.3 mmHg). After 1 month of adjunctive therapy, brimonidine and latanoprost provided comparable IOP lowering (4.88 mmHg [22.8%] with brimonidine and 5.01 mmHg [23.5%] with latanoprost, P = 0.798). Response rates were similar in both groups, with 44 of 54 brimonidine patients and 43 of 53 latanoprost patients achieving the minimum target 15% IOP reduction at peak drug effect at month 1 (P = 0.963). Among patients who were successful at month 1 and continued on the initial study medication, mean IOP reductions were 4.55 mmHg with brimonidine and 5.49 mmHg with latanoprost (P = 0.149) at month 3. There was no significant difference in the ability of brimonidine and latanoprost to maintain at least a 15% additional reduction in IOP for 3 months (28 of 38 patients on brimonidine vs. 30 of 36 patients on latanoprost achieved [greater-than or equal to]15% IOP reduction at month 3; P = 0.314). Patients in the latanoprost group were more likely to report negative quality-of-life variables than patients in the brimonidine group. Significantly more latanoprost patients reported watery or teary eyes (34 of 53, 64.2% vs. 23 of 54, 42.6% with brimonidine; P = 0.025) and hands and feet that became cold easily (24 of 53, 45.3% vs. 12 of 54, 22.2% with brimonidine; P = 0.012). Conclusions: As adjunct therapy with B-blockers, brimonidine twice daily and latanoprost every day were comparable in lowering IOP at peak effect, but brimonidine was better tolerated, with fewer reports of adverse quality-of-life effects. copyright 2002 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology."

METHODS: Randomized, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group study involving 371 patients with inadequate IOP control (IOP from 22 to 34 mmHg) after > or =3 weeks of run-in on any monotherapy. Patients were treated with fixed-combination brimonidine/timolol BID (fixed-combination group, n = 188) or concomitant brimonidine BID and timolol BID (concomitant group, n = 183). IOP was assessed pre-dose and 2 hours after morning dosing at weeks 2, 6, and 12. RESULTS: A total of 355 patients (96%) completed the study. Patient demographics, run-in monotherapy, and baseline mean IOP on monotherapy were comparable between treatment groups. During follow-up, the mean reduction from baseline IOP was significant (p < 0.001) at all time points and ranged from 4.4 to 5.3 mmHg in each group. Brimonidine/timolol fixed combination was as effective as concomitant therapy with respect to mean IOP and mean change from baseline IOP at all time points and visits. Between-group differences were < or =0.35 mmHg for mean IOP and < or 0.30 mmHg for mean change from baseline IOP; none were significant. No unexpected side effects were associated with the fixed combination. Both treatments were well tolerated with no difference in adverse events between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Brimonidine/timolol fixed-combination therapy is as safe and effective as concomitant treatment with the individual components. Its simplified dosing regimen has the potential to improve compliance."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 37 patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension under treatment with antiglaucoma ophthalmic solutions including 0.5% twice-daily timolol maleate participated in this study. Only timolol maleate was withdrawn and either Timoptol XE or Lizmon TG was randomly allocated. After instillation for 1 month, the other ophthalmic solution was subsequently instilled for another month. Routine ophthalmic examination including slit-lamp examination and intraocular pressure (IOP) monitoring was conducted before instillation of gel-forming ophthalmic solutions and just after completing the instillation of each ophthalmic solution. Patient questionnaire surveys were also performed just after completing the instillation of each ophthalmic solution. RESULTS: Mean IOP, just before the withdrawal of timolol ophthalmic solution, was 16.4 +/- 2.9 mm Hg. At the end of Timoptol XE or Lizmon TG instillation, mean IOPs were 16.3 +/- 2.5 or 16.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg, respectively. The results of the questionnaire survey showed no significant difference between Timoptol XE and Lizmon TG in regard to all survey items. Twenty-nine patients (78.4%) preferred to use gel-forming timolol solutions rather than twice-daily timolol ophthalmic solution. The presence of concurrently used ophthalmic solutions did not effect the incidences of subjective symptoms. The incidences of objective adverse effects were not significantly different between two gel-forming timolol ophthalmic solutions. CONCLUSION: Both gel-forming timolol ophthalmic solutions could be good choices for glaucoma treatment."

In an effort to provide a once daily dosing regimen, carteolol was formulated with 1% alginic acid. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of carteolol alginate solution in comparison with standard carteolol solution. METHODS: This was a double masked, parallel group, multicentre study. Patients with ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma (n=235) were randomly assigned to receive either carteolol alginate once daily [corrected] or standard carteolol solution, twice daily. The masking was maintained through the use of a vehicle in the evening for the alginate group. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 15, 60, and 120 days. RESULTS: At 0900 (presumed trough) on day 60, mean reductions in intraocular pressure (IOP) from baseline were 6.09 (SD 2.97) and 6.09 (3.18) mm Hg for the standard carteolol and alginate, respectively. At 1100 (presumed peak), mean reductions were 6.51 (2.53) and 6.47 (2.76) mm Hg, respectively. Results were similar at other times (day 15 and day 120). The most common side effect was transient stinging on instillation of drops, which did not differ significantly between groups. There were no differences of note in other ocular or systemic signs or symptoms. CONCLUSION: The new alginate formulation of carteolol 2% given once daily was as effective as standard carteolol 2% given twice daily with no meaningful differences regarding safety.

METHODS: A prospective, double-masked, randomized, comparative, multicenter, 4-month ""real-life"" clinical trial involving 188 patients. Medications were instilled twice daily. Efficacy was determined through measurement of intraocular pressure; safety and tolerability were measured using reports of adverse events, a quality of life survey (Glaucoma Disability Index), heart rate, and blood pressure. Patients with an inadequate response in intraocular pressure after 1 month or those who experienced significant adverse events in the first month were switched to the alternative study arm and remained taking the alternative medication for a total of 4 months or left the study. The main outcome measure was clinical success, as determined by evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of drug treatment, and was achieved when the investigator recommended that the patient continue the treatment after completion of the study. RESULTS: As initial therapy, clinical success was achieved in 74% of patients treated with brimonidine, as compared with 57% of patients treated with betaxolol (P = 0.027). The overall mean decrease in intraocular pressure from baseline was 5.9 mm Hg with brimonidine and 3.8 mm Hg with betaxolol.

A randomized, double-blind study was conducted to compare the effects of betaxolol and timolol on visual fields of glaucoma patients. METHODS: Sixty-four glaucoma patients were treated with either 0.5% betaxolol or 0.25% timolol eyedrops twice daily. The Octopus visual field performance was followed up for 2 years and analyzed to find diffuse and localized changes. We analyzed the change in the mean sensitivity (MS) and performed a cluster analysis and clinical assessment of the visual fields in both treatment groups. RESULTS: The mean sensitivity (MS) improved significantly and equally in both treatment groups. There was a tendency towards more improved clusters in the betaxolol group than in the timolol group and more worsened cluster in the timolol group than in the betaxolol group, but the difference was not statistically significant. The clinical assessment also showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In the present study both betaxolol and timolol had a favorable effect on the visual fields of glaucoma patients.

METHODS: Masked randomized prospective trial. This study included 51 patients (64 eyes) with newly diagnosed glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The cases were randomly divided into two treatment groups for administration of latanoprost 0.005% once daily, or of carteolol 2% twice daily and pilocarpine 2% twice daily. Mean diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at baseline, week 2, week 4, and month 3 after the beginning of treatment. Changes in mean IOP from baseline to the 3-month visit were determined by an analysis of variance. RESULTS: Mean diurnal IOP values were 25.1 +/- 3.1 mm Hg and 25.5 +/- 2.5 mm Hg at baseline in the latanoprost monotherapy group and in the carteolol-plus-pilocarpine group, respectively. Diurnal IOP was significantly decreased from baseline to 3 months in both groups (P <.001).

DESIGN: Following a 1-week run-in period on timolol 0.5% once daily, 139 patients were randomized to once-daily treatment with a fixed combination of timolol 0.5% and latanoprost 0.001% (comb. 10) or latanoprost 0.005% (comp. 50) or to the individual monotherapies. The IOP was measured at inclusion and at 8 a.m., noon and 4 p.m. on days 1, 7 and 28. RESULTS: Comb. 10, comb. 50, latanoprost and timolol reduced IOP by 3.7, 6.1, 4.9 and 2.1 mmHg, respectively, from a baseline mean diurnal IOP (+/- SEM) of 24.8 +/- 0.5, 24.1 +/- 0.4, 25.2 +/- 1.2 and 24.8 +/- 0.9 mmHg, respectively. The difference in IOP reduction was significant between comb. 50 and comb. 10 (P < 0.001), latanoprost (P = 0.046) and timolol (P < 0.001) in favor of comb. 50. There was also a significant difference between latanoprost and timolol (P = 0.007), in favor of latanoprost. All treatments were generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that a fixed combination of latanoprost 0.005% and timolol 0.5% could be useful in the treatment of glaucoma.

"Purpose: To determine the impact of coadminstration of systemic beta-blockers on the ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety of topical timolol, a nonselective beta-blocker, and that of brimonidine, an alpha2-selective adrenergic agonist, in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Design: Post hoc evaluation of data collected from two prospective, multicenter, randomized, doublemasked, parallel-group, actively-controlled, 12-month clinical trials. Participants: Of the 926 subjects with ocular hypertension or glaucoma that were enrolled in the two prospective trials, 66 (7.1%) were concurrently maintained on systemic beta-blocker therapy. Of these patients, 34 had been assigned to the brimonidine group and 32 to the timolol group. Methods: Subjects instilled into each eye either 1 drop of brimonidine 0.2% or timolol 0.5% twice daily for 1 year. Study subjects within medication treatment groups were classified as to their use or nonuse of concurrent systemic beta-blockers, and mean intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction, adverse events, heart rate, and blood pressure were compared. Main Outcome Measures: Mean IOP reduction from baseline was the primary efficacy variable. Adverse events and mean changes in heart rate and blood pressure from baseline were the primary safety variables. Results: Timolol-treated subjects concurrently taking systemic beta-blockers had smaller decreases in IOP, a greater mean change in systolic (at week 2, months 1, 2, 6, and 9; P [less-than or equal to] 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (months 2 and 6; P [less-than or equal to] 0.02), and a significantly greater mean decrease in heart rate (month 6; P = 0.004) compared with timolol subjects not taking systemic beta-blockers. By contrast, there was a modest enhancement of IOP-lowering efficacy at trough and no effect on blood pressure or heart rate in brimonidine-treated subjects who were concurrently receiving systemic beta-blocker therapy compared with brimonidine subjects not receiving systemic beta-blockers. Conclusions: Concurrent systemic beta-blocker therapy had no deleterious effect on ocular hypotensive efficacy and no impact on systemic safety parameters with topical brimonidine, whereas efficacy was reduced and systemic safety parameters were impacted with topical timolol. Ocular hypotensive agents other than beta-blockers, such as the alpha2 agonist brimonidine, may be a more appropriate first-line therapy for ocular hypertension and glaucoma patients concurrently taking systemic beta-blockers.

METHODS: The effects of 0.5% timolol in gel-forming solution on IOP and optic nerve head capillary blood speed were studied in 12 patients with untreated ocular hypertension. Optic nerve capillary blood speed was measured using the laser Doppler technique before and at the end of each treatment period. RESULTS: In each patient, IOP decreased after treatment with timolol (mean decrease 16.8% versus placebo). Systemic blood pressure and pulse rate did not differ significantly after treatment with topical timolol from values after placebo. The mean change from baseline in Doppler broadening was 10.6% greater after treatment with timolol than after placebo. There was no significant change in mean Doppler broadening from baseline after treatment with either timolol or placebo. However, optic nerve head capillary blood speed increased in six patients, and was within the range of placebo response in six patients after treatment with timolol. Spearman correlation analysis of the baseline with Doppler broadening measurements after treatment showed a correlation for placebo but not for timolol. The percent change in Doppler broadening after timolol treatment was correlated with iris color. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that administration of timolol for 4 weeks reduces IOP in patients with ocular hypertension and generally does not change the blood circulation in the optic nerve head. Individual patients, however, showed variable changes in optic nerve head circulation after topical administration of timolol. Although the sample size was small, these changes in optic nerve head circulation were correlated with iris color."

METHODS: Brimonidine 0.2% was given topically twice daily for 29 days to one eye each of 28 ocular hypertensive volunteers in a randomized double-masked study. The fellow eye was similarly treated with vehicle. Aqueous flow (Fa) and outflow facility (C(fl)) were determined with fluorophotometry. Intraocular pressure, outflow facility (C(ton)), and episcleral venous pressure (Pev) were measured with pneumatonometry, tonography, and venomanometry, respectively. Uveoscleral outflow (Fu) was calculated from intraocular pressure, Fa, Pev, and C(fl) values. All measurements were taken on baseline day, day 8, and day 29 of treatment. Intraocular pressure and Fa only were measured after instillation of 1 drop of brimonidine on day 1. RESULTS: When measured 3 hours after instillation on days 1, 8, and 29 of treatment, brimonidine significantly (P < .001) reduced intraocular pressure by at least 5.0 +/- 0.7 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) compared with baseline day, and by 2.7 +/- 0.5 mm Hg compared with the vehicle-treated contralateral control eyes. The greatest decrease (6.0 +/- 0.6 mm Hg) was observed at 3 hours after the first drop. Aqueous flow was reduced by 29% (P < .001) after the first application but was not significantly different from baseline when measured at day 29 of treatment. Uveoscleral outflow was increased 60% at day 8 (P < .06) and day 29 (P < .05) compared with baseline. There was no significant difference in outflow facility or episcleral venous pressure at day 8 or day 29 of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The brimonidine- induced reduction in intraocular pressure in humans is associated initially with a decrease in aqueous flow, and after chronic-treatment with an increase in uveoscleral outflow."

METHODS: Two hundred forty-one patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, who had intraocular pressure between 22 and 36 mm Hg in at least one eye, were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Timolol GFS 0.5% once daily or Timoptic XE 0.5% once daily, in a 12-month randomized, multicenter, double-masked, prospective study. The primary efficacy variable was mean trough intraocular pressure measured at 8:00 AM, approximately 24 hours after dosing. RESULTS: The Timolol GFS 0.5% group produced significant trough intraocular pressure reductions from a baseline of 4.5 to 5.2 mm Hg (P =.0001), compared with reductions of 4.1 to 5. 3 mm Hg (P =.0001) in the Timoptic XE 0.5% group. The difference in mean intraocular pressure between the two treatments was 0.9 mm Hg or less, and the upper 95% confidence limit between groups was 0.92 mm Hg or less at all time points, demonstrating both clinical and statistical equivalence. A similar percentage of patients in the Timolol GFS 0.5% group (71%) and Timoptic XE group (72%) had clinically relevant reductions in intraocular pressure. There was no significant difference in the safety profiles of the two treatments. CONCLUSION: Both treatments were clinically effective in lowering intraocular pressure and maintaining the reductions over long-term use.

Methods: This randomized, parallel-group study was conducted at 45 U.S. sites over 12 weeks. Previously treated open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension patients with an intraocular pressure (IOP) 2'23 mmHg in 1 or 2 eyes after washout received latanoprost, bimatoprost, or travoprost once daily (evening). At baseline and weeks 6 and 12, IOP was measured in triplicate by masked evaluators at 8:00 AM, noon, 4:00 PM, and 8:00 PM. Conjunctival hyperemia was graded by masked investigators before the 8:00 AM IOP measurement at each visit. Patients also were asked whether their red eyes bothered them. Change between baseline and week 12 in 8:00 AM IOP measurements was the primary efficacy outcome. Post-hoc analyses of responder rates, power calculations, and hyperemia gradings were conducted. Results: Responder rates based on percentages of patients achieving either a 15% or 20% reduction in IOP at week 12 were almost identical for all 3 prostaglandin analogs as were proportions of patients reaching specific target IOP levels. At 6 and 12 weeks, no statistically significant difference between treatments was found in the IOP-lowering effect measured at 8:00 AM. Post-hoc power calculations indicated a 91 % power to detect a difference of 1.5 mmHg between treatment arms. There was a small but significant increase at all time points after baseline in mean hyperemia scores in the bimatoprost and travoprost treatment groups, with the bimatoprost group having the largest increase and the latanoprost group the smallest increase. Patient responses to hyperemia were consistent with investigator gradings. Conclusions: Mean IOP levels at week 12 were similar across treatment groups at all time points as were the responder rates and proportions of patients reaching specific target pressures. There appears to be no statistical or clinical differences in efficacy among the 3 prostaglandin analogs."

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of two different regimens of latanoprost on the diurnal IOP and also the effect of latanoprost on the blood-aqueous barrier measured with a laser flare cell meter (Kowa FM-500). Moreover, the safety aspects of the two regimens regarding hyperemia were studied. METHODS: A double-masked, randomized study was performed in 30 patients (9 males, 21 females; mean age 61.9 years) with primary open-angle glaucoma or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma. Twenty patients were treated with latanoprost 0.0015% twice daily or 0.005% once daily for 3 weeks in a cross-over design. Ten patients received timolol 0.5% twice daily as control. RESULTS: Latanoprost 0.005% once daily reduced IOP (+/- SEM) more effectively than latanoprost 0.0015% twice daily (9.8 +/- 0.9 mm Hg and 6.7 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, respectively). There was a statistically significant increase in the aqueous humour protein concentration within the timolol group (P = 0.004), but not within the latanoprost group (P = 0.97). There was no statistically significant difference in the change in aqueous humour protein concentration from baseline between latanoprost and timolol groups (P = 0.08). No statistically significant difference in conjunctival hyperemia between the two latanoprost regimens was found (P = 0.37). CONCLUSION: Latanoprost 0.005% once daily reduced IOP more effectively than latanoprost 0.0015% twice daily (P < 0.001).

Comparative efficacy of orally and topically administered beta blockers for chronic simple glaucoma	British Journal of Ophthalmology	Br.J.Ophthalmol.	1985	69	1	41	45	"This open study of beta blockers in chronic simple glaucoma compared the efficacy of once daily (o.d.) oral nadolol therapy with twice daily (b.d.) topical timolol therapy. Sixty eight patients were randomly assigned to starting doses of either 20, 40, or 80 mg of nadolol o.d. (51 patients) or 0.25% timolol b.d. (17 patients) and were seen at weekly intervals for a four-week (short-term) period. Upward dosage titration (80 mg o.d. maximum, nadolol and 0.5% b.d. maximum, timolol) was permitted if, at any visit, the intraocular pressure (IOP) in either eye was greater than 21 mmHg. At the end of 4 weeks the IOPs of a comparable number of patients were controlled (IOP less than 22 mmHg) with 20 mg nadolol o.d. and 0.25% timolol b.d. The 40 mg and 80 mg o.d. nadolol regimens were comparable with each other, superior to the 20 mg regimen, and (at least) equivalent to 0.5% timolol. The absolute degree of IOP reduction achieved with oral nadolol was equivalent to that with topical timolol. Alterations in blood pressure and heart rate were predictably greater with the orally administered beta blocker. Long-term therapy (up to 24 months) in 28 nadolol patients and 5 timolol patients indicates no more likelihood of tolerance with nadolol therapy. Patient withdrawals from the study due to adverse reactions occurred with nadolol but not timolol. Since oral nadolol administered once daily is as efficacious as b.d. topical timolol, it can be recommended as first-line therapy for certain subsets of the glaucoma clinic population.

Comparison of the nocturnal effects of once-daily timolol and latanoprost on intraocular pressure	American Journal of Ophthalmology	Am.J.Ophthalmol.	2004	138	3	389	395	"PURPOSE: To compare the nocturnal effects of once-daily timolol and latanoprost on intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with ocular hypertension or early glaucomatous changes. DESIGN: Prospective, open-label, experimental study with crossover design. METHODS: Eighteen patients with ocular hypertension or early glaucomatous changes (aged 41 to 79 years) each received topical treatments with timolol (0.5% Timoptic-XE), latanoprost (0.005% Xalatan), and no IOP-lowering medication, for at least 4 weeks. Timolol was given once in the morning upon awakening and latanoprost once in the evening at bedtime. At the end of each treatment period, the patient was housed in a sleep laboratory for 24 hours and IOP was measured every 2 hours using a pneumatonometer. Measurements were taken sitting and supine during the 16-hour diurnal/wake period and only supine during the 8-hour nocturnal/sleep period. Mean diurnal and nocturnal IOP levels were compared among the treatments with timolol, latanoprost, and no medication. RESULTS: In the diurnal period, the mean IOP under the timolol or the latanoprost treatment was significantly less than the mean IOP under no medication in both the sitting and the supine positions. There was no statistical difference between the timolol and latanoprost treatments. In the nocturnal period, supine IOP with timolol treatment was not different from the supine IOP with no medication but was significantly higher than supine IOP with the latanoprost treatment. CONCLUSION: Although both once-daily timolol and latanoprost were effective in lowering IOP during the diurnal period, only latanoprost reduced IOP during the nocturnal period."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, double-masked trial, 37 patients were treated twice daily with timolol for 4 weeks. Then, they were randomized to one of the treatment medications for 6 weeks, after which they were treated with timolol again for 2 weeks before placed on the opposite treatment medication for 6 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients completed the trial. The mean baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) was 22.3 +/- 3.7 mmHg. Following 6 weeks of treatment, the mean decrease of IOP was 18.0 +/- 2.2 mmHg for timolol/dorzolamide combination and 17.4 +/- 2.0 for timolol/pilocarpine combination. The mean diurnal curve IOP was 18.1 +/- 2.2 mmHg for timolol/dorzolamide group and 16.7 +/- 1.9 mmHg for timolol/pilocarpine group. These differences were statistically significant. Statistically more patients reported ocular pain and diminished vision during use of the timolol/pilocarpine combination. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggest that timolol 0.5%/pilocarpine 2% fixed combination can provide at least similar efficacious reduction in IOP as timolol 0.5 %/dorzolamide 2% fixed combination in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension."

DESIGN: Prospective, 6-month, randomized, controlled, multicenter, double-masked, phase III study. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred five patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. METHODS: Patients with an 8 AM IOP between 24 to 36 mmHg in at least one eye (the same eye) at two eligibility visits received either travoprost 0.0015%, travoprost 0.004% (dosed every day), or timolol 0.5% (dosed twice daily). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean IOP at 8 AM, 10 AM, and 4 PM in the patient's eye with the higher baseline IOP. RESULTS: The mean IOP was significantly lower for both concentrations of travoprost compared with timolol. Travoprost was statistically superior to timolol at 9 of 13 visits, with differences in IOP reductions ranging from 0.9 to 1.8 mmHg (0.0015%) and 10 of 13 visits with differences in IOP reductions from 0.9 to 2.4 mmHg (0.004%). Mean IOP changes from baseline ranged from -6.0 to -7.5 mmHg (0.0015%), -6.5 to -8.0 mmHg (0.004%), and -5.2 to -7.0 mmHg for timolol. Hyperemia was experienced at rates of 29.2% (59 of 202) for travoprost 0.0015%, 42.8% (86 of 201) for travoprost 0.004%, and 8.9% (18 of 202) for timolol. Iris pigmentation changes were observed in 1.0% (2 of 200) of patients receiving travoprost 0.004% with no changes noted in the travoprost 0.0015% group or the timolol group. A decrease in pulse and systolic blood pressure was observed in the timolol group. There were no other clinically relevant or statistically significant changes from baseline in ocular signs or laboratory values, and no serious, related, unexpected adverse events were reported for any group. CONCLUSIONS: Travoprost (0.0015% and 0.004%), dosed once daily in the evening, is statistically superior or equal to timolol 0.5% dosed twice daily at all treatment visits during this 6-month study. IOP reductions of up to 2.0 mmHg greater than timolol were found in the travoprost 0.004% pooled data group.

Methods: This was a randomized, crossover, investigator-masked, active-control study of primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertensive patients. Patients received either once-daily 0.5% timolol GFS (n = 40) or once daily 0.005% latanoprost (n = 35) for 8 weeks (Period 1). Patients were then crossed over to the other medication and treated for another 8 weeks (Period 2). Intraocular pressure (IOP) was determined every 2 hours from 8:00 to 20:00 at baseline, and Weeks 8 and 16. Safety was assessed by visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, and adverse event reports. Results: During Period 1, the reduction in mean diurnal IOP in latanoprost-treated patients was significantly greater than in timolol GFS-treated patients (-6.9 &plusmn; 3.0 mm Hg and -5.5 &plusmn; 2.4 mm Hg respectively, P = 0.034). There was also a significant reduction from baseline in IOP after switching from timolol GFS to latanoprost (P < 0.001), not observed when patients were switched from latanoprost to timolol GFS. Latanoprost reduced IOP more than timolol GFS after combining each drug's treatment periods between treatment arms (-6.9 &plusmn; 2.9 mm Hg and -6.2 &plusmn; 2.7 mm Hg respectively, P = 0.018). The most common adverse events in both treatment groups were hyperemia (44%), blepharitis (17%) and erythema (11%). Four patients withdrew early, two for potential drug related events, one on latanoprost had conjunctival erythema and one on timolol GFS had increased heart rate and blood pressure. Conclusions: Latanoprost is more effective than timolol GFS in reducing IOP and patients switched from timolol GFS to latanoprost have a further significant reduction in IOP."

DESIGN: Multicenter, 3-month, randomized, double-masked, interventional comparison trial. PARTICIPANTS: Patients diagnosed with ocular hypertension or glaucoma (n = 596). INTERVENTION: Patients received bimatoprost 0.03% ophthalmic solution once daily (8 PM, with vehicle control at 8 AM), bimatoprost 0.03% twice daily (8 AM; 8 PM), or timolol 0.5% twice daily (8 AM; 8 PM) in an uneven 2:2:1 randomization. Scheduled visits were at prestudy, baseline (day 0), weeks 2 and 6, and month 3. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at 8 AM (predose), 10 AM, and 4 PM. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was reduction in IOP in the eye with higher IOP at baseline. Secondary outcome measures included safety variables (adverse events, ophthalmoscopy, biomicroscopy, iris pigmentation, laser-flare meter, visual acuity, visual fields, heart rate, blood pressure, blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis). RESULTS: At month 3, the mean reduction in IOP from baseline at 8 AM was 9.16 mmHg (35.2%) with bimatoprost once daily, 7.78 mmHg (30.4%) with bimatoprost twice daily, and 6.74 mmHg (26.2%) with timolol twice daily. At all follow-up visits, mean IOP reductions were significantly greater in the bimatoprost once daily group than in the timolol group at each time point (8 AM, 10 AM, and 4 PM; P < 0.001). Twice-daily dosing of bimatoprost also provided significantly greater mean reductions in IOP than timolol at most time points but was not as effective as once-daily dosing. Bimatoprost was associated with significantly more hyperemia and eyelash growth than timolol, whereas timolol was associated with significantly more burning and stinging sensation in eyes. Overall, bimatoprost was well tolerated with few discontinuations because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Bimatoprost 0.03% once daily was safe and statistically superior to timolol 0.5% twice daily in lowering IOP in patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma. Bimatoprost given once daily consistently provided IOP reductions approximately 2 to 3 mmHg greater than those provided by timolol. Once-daily dosing of bimatoprost, 0.03%, demonstrated greater IOP-lowering effect and better ocular tolerability than twice-daily dosing."

Patients using any drugs affecting plasma lipids or with a history of beta-blocker use of hyperlipoproteinemia were excluded. Fasting blood lipids and lipoproteins, including total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and apoproteins, were measured three times before therapy was initiated. These measurements were repeated every 4 weeks during the treatment period. RESULTS: The level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly decreased in the timolol treatment group but did not change in the carteolol treatment groups. The ratio of total cholesterol minus high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in the timolol treatment group.

DESIGN: Open label randomized clinical study. METHODS: Fifty-two patients (52 eyes) with primary open-angle glaucoma were randomly divided into two groups. One group initially received only latanoprost 0.005% once daily and the other group, only unoprostone 0.12% twice daily. The study period was 12 weeks: in the first 6 weeks, latanoprost or unoprostone was given as monotherapy, and in the last 6 weeks, patients received both drugs. IOP was measured every 2 weeks by one investigator masked to the medication received by patients during the study period in the same hour as on the baseline day. At Weeks 0, 6, and 12, the coefficient of aqueous outflow was measured by tonography. RESULTS: With latanoprost monotherapy, the baseline IOP of 22.9 +/- 2.4 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) decreased to 16.9 +/- 2.1 mm Hg (P<.01). When unoprostone was added to latanoprost, the IOP remained at 16.7 +/- 2.5 mm Hg. With unoprostone monotherapy, the baseline IOP of 22.7 +/- 2.1 mm Hg decreased to 19.4 +/- 2.4 mm Hg (P<.01). When latanoprost was added to unoprostone, the IOP decreased to 16.8 +/- 1.7 mm Hg (P<.01).

DESIGN: Longitudinal randomized clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-eight eyes of 152 ocular hypertensive participants ages 40 to 80 years. METHODS: Cox hazard models were applied to 3232 eyes, which included 81 eyes that reached a study end point by developing a glaucomatous VF (VF end point) and 128 eyes that reached a study end point by developing an optic disc change (optic disc end point). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary open-angle glaucoma end point as determined by changes in the VF or optic disc. RESULTS: Forty-one eyes reached an end point by both VF and optic disc criteria; 40 eyes reached only a VF end point, and 87 reached only an optic disc end point. Times to reach isolated disc or field end points were similar. Visual field end points were more likely (P<0.0001) in eyes that showed the following ONH features: an ONH hemorrhage, thinning of the optic disc rim, or enlargement of the horizontal cup-to-disc (C/D) ratio. Optic disc end points were more likely (P<0.0001) in eyes that showed the following VF features: some evidence of a nasal step or a partial arcuate VF defect, or an increase in the pattern standard deviation (PSD). CONCLUSIONS: Both the VF and the optic disc must be monitored with equal diligence, because either may show the first evidence of glaucomatous damage. Changes in the ONH based on stereophotographic observation (rim thinning, hemorrhage, or a slight increase in C/D ratio) and VF changes (evidence of a nasal step/partial arcuate defect or an increase in PSD) suggest that these cases have an increased risk of developing glaucoma. Confirmation of such subtle findings should be sought through repeat testing and correlation with other clinical results."

METHODS: In a 6-month, multicenter, randomized, open-label study 242 patients with POAG or OH whose IOP was not controlled with timolol 0.5% b.i.d. were enrolled. Eyes had not been treated with pilocarpine and latanoprost for at least 2 years. An analysis of covariance with diurnal IOP change from baseline to month 6 for study eyes was performed. RESULTS: Four patients on latanoprost 0.005% and 35 on pilocarpine 2% did not complete the study (P<0.001). Two hundred and forty patients were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. For both treatments the diurnal IOP reduction after 6 months was statistically significant (P<0.001). IOP (mean+/-SD) was reduced from 23.3+/-2.8 to 17.8+/-2.8 (-5.6) mmHg in the latanoprost 0.005% group and from 23.0+/-3.2 to 18.5+/-2.4 (-4.8) mmHg in pilocarpine 2% t.i.d.-treated eyes.

Treatment versus no treatment in chronic open angle glaucoma	Acta Ophthalmologica	Acta Ophthalmol.	1988	66	2	170	173	"In a controlled randomized study 15 patients (20 eyes) with chronic open angle glaucoma and visual field defects were followed by greater than 1 year, 12 of them were followed for 3 years. Half of the group were untreated controls, the other half treated with pressure reducing medical therapy. At least 5 consecutive computerized visual fields were recorded (COMPETER) on each eye, and the linear regression coefficient was calculated. With the reservation for uncontrolled compliance no significant difference in the line of favourable effect of pressure reduction could be spotted, in spite of an average pressure reduction in the treated group of 4 mmHg. More important than this result, which is open to criticism for the smallness of the material, uncontrolled compliance etc, is the lesson that a randomized experiment with treated and non-treated glaucoma cases carried out in accordance with the Helsingfors convention is hardly feasible."

Effects of betaxolol and latanoprost on ocular blood flow and visual fields in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma	European journal of ophthalmology	Eur.J.Ophthalmol.	2004	14	3	211	219	"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of betaxolol and latanoprost on ocular blood flow and visual fields in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) by means of an observer-masked, prospective clinical study. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with newly diagnosed POAG were included in the study. The patients were randomized into two groups. The first group was treated with betaxolol 0.50% twice daily and the second group with latanoprost 0.005% once daily. Baseline and posttreatment examinations on the first and third months of treatment included intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement, automated visual field testing, and ocular blood flow assessment. For evaluation of visual fields, mean defect and pattern standard deviation indices were used. Ocular blood flow was assessed by means of color Doppler imaging of the central retinal artery (CRA) and the temporal short posterior ciliary artery (PCA). For each vessel, peak systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic (EDV) blood flow velocities were measured and resistivity index (RI) calculated. RESULTS: After exclusion of one noncompliant patient, the study was completed with 31 eyes of 31 patients. Both drugs significantly reduced IOP (p0.05). There were no significant changes in PSV or EDV measurements of CRA or PCA in either group (p>0.05). RI decreased in both CRA and PCA with both drugs. The mean changes between baseline and 3 month blood flow measurements were not significantly different between betaxolol and latanoprost (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Over a treatment period of 3 months, both betaxolol and latanoprost tended to improve ocular blood flow without one of them being superior to the other. The results suggest that the direct (non IOP-dependent) influence on ocular circulation is better for betaxolol than for latanoprost. In addition, neither drug caused significant generalized improvements in visual fields during this period.

The effect of brimonidine tartrate on retinal blood flow in patients with ocular hypertension	American Journal of Ophthalmology	Am.J.Ophthalmol.	2000	129	3	297	301	"PURPOSE: To study the effects of topical brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, an alpha2-agonist ocular hypotensive drug, on retinal capillary blood flow in patients with ocular hypertension. METHODS: The study was a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial set in a tertiary eye center. Ocular hypertensive patients with repeatable intraocular pressures greater than 21 mm Hg and normal visual fields and optic disks were consecutively recruited. After an eye examination, baseline retinal blood flow measurements were made with confocal scanning laser Doppler flowmetry in one study eye. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive either brimonidine or placebo (saline) twice daily for 8 weeks. Blood flow and intraocular pressure measurements were then repeated after 4 and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were randomly assigned to receive brimonidine, and 14 received placebo. One patient in each group failed to complete the study. The mean group differences in baseline age and intraocular pressure were not statistically significant (59.23 [+/-10.24] and 52.23 [+/-16.46] years, respectively, and 24.84 [+/-2.08] and 24.56 [+/-2.85] mm Hg, respectively). Brimonidine reduced intraocular pressure by 17.90% and 16.17% at 4 and 8 weeks, respectively, with a significant difference in treatment effect compared with the placebo group (P .360). Based on a type I error of 0.05, our study had a power greater than or equal to 75% to detect group differences in treatment effect of greater than or equal to 15% to 20%.

Patients and Methods. A randomized, double-masked, multicenter study was conducted in 209 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, whose intraocular pressure (IOP) was higher than 21 mm Hg on bet-blocker twice a day alone. The test medications were administered twice daily for 4 months. IOP was measured at 9 and 11 a.m. at the beginning of the study (with beta- blocker alone) and after one and four months of treatment. Adverse effects were recorded. Results. Both combinations caused a similar, statistically significant decrease in IOP. At four months, in the CBS341A group a 2.4 mm Hg (9%) reduction in IOP was achieved at 9 a.m. and 4.1 mm Hg (17.3%) at 11 a.m. compared with respectively 3 mm Hg (11%) and 4.5 mm Hg (19.5%) in the timolol-pilocarpine group.

METHODS: This was a multicentre, randomised, observer masked, 6 week study performed in France and Sweden. 23 centres enrolled 237 patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension and an IOP of at least 22 mm Hg on treatment with topical beta adrenergic antagonists, alone or in combination. After a 21 day run in period on timolol 0.5% twice daily, patients were randomised either to latanoprost 0.005% once daily or to a fixed combination of timolol-pilocarpine twice daily. Changes in mean diurnal IOP from the baseline to the 6 week visit were determined with an analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Mean diurnal IOP was statistically significantly decreased from baseline in both groups (p<0.001). Switching to latanoprost treatment reduced mean diurnal IOP by 5.4 (SEM 0.3) mm Hg (ANCOVA -22%) and switching to timolol-pilocarpine treatment reduced mean diurnal IOP by 4.9 (0.4) mm Hg (-20%). Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, decreased twilight vision, and headache were statistically significantly more frequent in the timolol-pilocarpine group. CONCLUSIONS: Latanoprost monotherapy was at least as effective as fixed combination timolol-pilocarpine twice daily treatment in reducing mean diurnal IOP in patients not adequately controlled on topical beta adrenergic antagonists. Latanoprost was better tolerated than timolol-pilocarpine regarding side effects. These results indicate that a switch to latanoprost monotherapy can be attempted before combination therapy is initiated."

"Background. This study was designed to determine the efficacy and safety of latanoprost 50 mug/ml in Chinese patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular hypertension (OH). Methods. A 14-day randomized, double- masked, parallel-group study comparing topical latanoprost with placebo was followed by a 10-week, one-armed, open-labeled latanoprost treatment study. Intraocular pressure (IOP), visual function, ocular manifestations and miscellaneous adverse effects were evaluated at baseline, and days 1, 7, 14, 15, week 6 and week 12 visits. Results. Twenty-six eligible patients were enrolled in the study. The mean IOP was significantly reduced from baseline only in the latanoprost-treated eyes during the first study period (p = 0.003 on day 1; p = 0.004 on day 7; p < 0.001 on day 14). Meanwhile, the mean IOP was significantly lower in the latanoprost-treated eyes than that in the placebo-treated eyes (p = 0.03 on day 1; p = 0.001 on days 7 and 14). Eyes in both groups showed significantly reduced IOP at each visit of the secondary 10-week latanoprost treatment period, with a mean decrease of 6.12 mmHg. The IOP-lowering effect showed no diminution throughout the study course. Conjunctival hyperemia occurred in 16 of all patients who underwent latanoprost treatment and was the most frequent adverse effect observed. No patient withdrew from the study because of intolerable side-effects. Conclusions. Topical latanoprost is effective in reducing IOP for patients with POAG and OH. The pressure-lowering effect lasts for at least 24 hours after 1 drop instillation and no drift of effect is noted during this 12-week study. Conjunctival hyperemia was the most common side-effect, which was mild in degree and recovered after discontinuation of the medication."

After this baseline period, patients were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with timolol 0.5%, TP2, or TP4 for the subsequent four weeks. All medications were administered twice daily. A statistically significant reduction from baseline in mean morning IOP was apparent after both one and four weeks of double-blind therapy in the two groups assigned to receive the timolol and pilocarpine combinations. The IOP reduction in patients who continued to receive timolol monotherapy did not differ significantly from the baseline value after one week of treatment but did reach statistical significance by the end of the study. At the one-week evaluations, the reductions in IOP achieved in the two groups treated with timolol and pilocarpine were significantly greater than that in the group treated only with timolol. At the end of the study, a significant difference was detected between the IOP reduction obtained with timolol 0.5% alone and that achieved with TP4. The study medications were well tolerated and had no significant effect on heart rate or blood pressure."

Fifty-five white patients with ocular hypertension entered a double-masked, placebo-controlled, four-period, incomplete block crossover study. After washout of any ocular hypotensive medications, the intraocular pressure of both eyes of all patients was measured at 0 (09:00 h), 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h (diurnal baseline). Patients were then randomized to receive, at 2-week intervals, one drop of each of four of the six treatments in one eye (0.008% timolol gel, 0.1% timolol gel, placebo gel, 0.008% timolol solution, 0.1% timolol solution, and placebo solution). Fellow eyes received the appropriate placebo. As measured by least-squares means, adjusted for the unmedicated baseline diurnal values, there was a clear dose-response, with the 0.1% treatments being more effective ocular hypotensive agents than the 0.008% treatments, which in turn were more effective than the placebo treatments. Within each concentration at several observation points, the gel formulation elicited a 1-2-mm Hg greater efficacy than the solution. Gel-treated subjects had a greater incidence of blurred vision. We conclude that formulation of timolol with a gel may increase efficacy, and thus duration of action. This may possibly allow use of a lower concentration of timolol or a reduced frequency of instillation. Further evaluation in chronic dosing studies is justified."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy and safety of bimatoprost 0.03% compared with the association of timolol 0.5% and latanoprost 0.005% in open-angle glaucoma patients. METHODS: In this 6-month, prospective, parallel, randomised, investigator-masked clinical trial, 61 glaucomatous patients treated with timolol 0.5% twice in both eyes were enrolled. The timolol 0.5% was replaced by bimatoprost 0.03% once daily (group I) or by latanoprost 0.005% plus timolol 0.5% (group II). IOP measurements were performed at the baseline visit and at days 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180. Digital colour photography was used to evaluate topical side effects. RESULTS: Fifty-six of the 61 patients were included for the intent-to-treat analysis (28 in group I and 28 in group II). Baseline mean IOP was similar in the two groups (p=0.5). Both treatments lowered the mean IOP at every visit significantly compared with the baseline (p<0.01). Comparing the IOP reductions obtained by the two treatments, no significant differences were found at any time during the study. Conjunctival hyperaemia, skin pigmentation and eyelash growth in group I and headache in group II were the most common side effects observed during the study. CONCLUSIONS: Bimatoprost and the association of latanoprost plus timolol were equally effective in lowering the IOP in glaucomatous patients previously treated with timolol.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the IOPlowering efficacy and ocular tolerability of brimonidine-timolol compared with dorzolamide-timolol when used as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy to a prostaglandin analog (PGA) in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Study design and methods: Pooled data analysis of two randomized, investigator-masked, 3-month, parallel-group studies with identical protocols (ten sites). In all, 180 patients with openangle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who were in need of lower IOP received topical brimonidine-timolol BID or dorzolamide- timolol BID as monotherapy (n = 101) or as adjunctive therapy to a PGA (latanoprost, bimatoprost, or travoprost) (n = 79). Clinical trial registration: The studies are registered with the identifiers NCT00822081 and NCT00822055 at http:// www.clinicaltrials. gov. Main outcome measures: IOP was measured at 10 a.m. (peak effect) at baseline and at months 1 and 3. Tolerability/comfort was evaluated using a patient questionnaire. Results: There were no statistically significant between-group differences in patient demographics. Most patients were Caucasian, and the mean age was 68 years. There were also no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in baseline IOP. At month 3, the mean (SD) reduction from baseline IOP for patients on fixed-combination monotherapy was 7.7 (4.2) mmHg (32.3%) with brimonidine-timolol versus 6.7 (5.0) mmHg (26.1%) with dorzolamide-timolol (p = 0.040). The mean reduction from PGA-treated baseline IOP for patients on fixed-combination adjunctive therapy was 6.9 (4.8) mmHg (29.3%) with brimonidine-timolol versus 5.2 (3.7) mmHg (23.5%) with dorzolamide- timolol (p = 0.213).

DESIGN: A 3-month, parallel, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled, multicenter clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 335 patients with bilateral ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma participated. INTERVENTION: After completing a washout of ocular hypotensive medications, patients were randomized to receive either the dorzolamide-timolol combination twice daily plus placebo once daily, 0.5% timolol twice daily plus placebo once daily, or 2.0% dorzolamide three times daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at morning trough (hour 0) and peak (2 hours postdose) on day 1, week 2, and months 1, 2, and 3. Ocular and systemic safety were evaluated at each study visit. RESULTS: Intraocular pressure reduction was greater on average in the combination group than in the dorzolamide and timolol groups. At morning trough (month 3, hour 0), the mean reduction in IOP from baseline was 27.4% (-7.7 mmHg) for the combination, 15.5% (-4.6 mmHg) for dorzolamide, and 22.2% (-6.4 mmHg) for timolol. At morning peak (month 3, hour 2), the mean IOP reduction from baseline was 32.7% (-9.0 mmHg), 19.8% (-5.4 mmHg), and 22.6% (-6.3 mmHg) for the combination, dorzolamide, and timolol, respectively. Overall, the incidence of clinical adverse experiences was comparable between the combination and each of its components. The proportion of patients who discontinued from the study because of clinical adverse experiences was also comparable between the combination and dorzolamide, although it was significantly greater in the combination group than in the timolol group (7% vs. 1%, P = 0.035). Similarly, comparable numbers of patients in the combination and dorzolamide groups reported ocular symptoms; however, when compared to the timolol group, more patients receiving the combination reported blurred vision, burning eye, stinging eye, and tearing eye. CONCLUSIONS: After a washout of ocular hypotensive therapy, the IOP-lowering effect of the dorzolamide-timolol combination was greater than that of either of its components administered as monotherapy.

DESIGN: The 2 clinical trials described herein were prospective, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled, parallel group, multicenter studies. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1131 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension participated in 2 clinical trials and received either unoprostone isopropyl 0.15% (659), timolol maleate 0.5% (331), or betaxolol hydrochloride 0.5% (141), 1 drop per eye twice daily for up to 24 months. METHODS: Color photographs (1:1 magnification) were taken of the iris and eyelid of each patient at baseline and at regular intervals thereafter through month 24 using a standardized camera system. Photography included 7 views of each eye plus a calibration photograph and a patient identification photograph, for a total of 16 photographs per patient per visit. Two independent (masked) readers subjectively compared baseline iris colors to subsequent visits. Side view photographs of the upper and lower eyelashes were used for the eyelash length analysis, with each having sufficient depth of field and a sufficient number of eyelashes in focus. Similarly, frontal eyelash views were used for the eyelash density analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes from baseline in iris color and eyelash length and density within and between treatment groups. RESULTS: Seven cases of iris color change (1.06%) were confirmed in patients treated with unoprostone for up to 24 months; no confirmed cases were reported in the timolol or betaxolol groups. In the unoprostone group, cases of iris color change were confirmed at months 12 (1 case), 18 (2 cases), and 24 (4 cases). No clinically relevant differences were observed among treatment groups for changes from baseline in eyelash length or density. CONCLUSION: Although iris hyperpigmentation and abnormal eyelash changes may occur after treatment with unoprostone, the incidence of these events appears to be low in the 2-year clinical study.

DESIGN: A double-masked, parallel-group, active-controlled, multicenter clinical trial of 12 months' duration. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty-three patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were enrolled. Of these, 463 were evaluated according to the protocol criteria (280 in the brimonidine tartrate group and 183 in the timolol group). INTERVENTIONS: Brimonidine tartrate 0.2% or timolol maleate 0.5% was administered twice daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy variable was intraocular pressure (IOP). RESULTS: Brimonidine and timolol produced significant (P < 0.001) and sustained mean reductions in IOP throughout the 1-year follow-up when measured at hour 0 (trough) and at hour 2 (peak). At weeks 1 and 2 and month 12, significantly greater mean decreases in IOP measured at peak (P < or = 0.007) were observed in patients treated with brimonidine as compared to timolol, whereas the mean decreases in IOP measured at trough was significantly greater in patients treated with timolol as compared to brimonidine (P < 0.001) at all follow-up visits. Both drugs were well-tolerated. The incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups, except for ocular allergy, oral dryness, and conjunctival follicles, which occurred more frequently in the brimonidine group, and burning-stinging, which occurred more frequently in the timolol group. Patients receiving timolol experienced significant decreases in heart rate at all follow-up visits.

Phase III comparative study of MK-507 ophthalmic solution in primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension	FOLIA OPHTHALMOL JPN	 	1994	45	9	1023	1033	"The purpose of this study was to compare the ocular effect and safety of a 0.5% ophthalmic solution of MK-507 (generic name, dorzolamide hydrochloride), a newly developed carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, with timolol maleate 0.25% ophthalmic solution (timolol) as an active control drug in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. A total of 245 patients were topically given MK-507 three times a day or timolol twice a day for 12 weeks each, by random allocation. Both groups showed significant reduction in intraocular pressure throughout the 12 weeks. Outflow pressure mean reduction rate (A%) from week 8 to week 12 was 20% or more in 75.2% (85/113) and 80.4% (90/112) of the MK-507 and timolol groups, respectively. Side effects were reported in 8 patients (10 events) of the MK-507 group, mainly temporary smarting at instillation, with no systemic side effects. On the other hand, 8 patients (20 events) of the timolol group reported local or systemic side effects, though none were serious. No abnormal change in any item of examination was reported. The results suggest that MK-507 0.5% has an efficacy equivalent to timolol 0.25% in terms of intraocular pressure control, and is free from the systemic side effects often observed in treatment with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, indicating that it could be a promising antiglaucoma agent.

Efficacy of bunazosin hydrochloride 0.01% as adjunctive therapy of latanoprost or timolol	Journal of glaucoma	J.Glaucoma	2004	13	1	73	80	"PURPOSE: To evaluate the ocular hypotensive response of bunazosin hydrochloride 0.01% administered as adjunctive therapy in patients with glaucoma who were already receiving latanoprost 0.005% or timolol 0.5%. METHODS: Patients with primary open angle glaucoma who had received latanoprost (n = 60) or timolol (n = 60) for 6 months or longer were enrolled and prospectively randomized to receive additional administration of bunazosin or placebo. One hundred twenty eyes of 120 patients were thus divided into 4 subgroups of 30 patients each. Bunazosin was administered twice daily, and timolol or latanoprost was administered per label. The patients were followed up for 3 months. Responders were defined as having a reduction in intraocular pressure of greater than 2 mm Hg from baseline. RESULTS: Mean baseline intraocular pressure was 22.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg in the bunazosin subgroup and 22.3 +/- 3.1 mm Hg in the placebo subgroup of the latanoprost arm, and 22.5 +/- 3.5 mm Hg in the bunazosin subgroup and 22.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg in the placebo subgroup of the timolol arm. In the bunazosin subgroups of both arms, intraocular pressure was significantly reduced compared with baseline measurements (P < 0.05) with mean intraocular pressure measurement reductions of 2.1 +/- 2.4 mm Hg and 2.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg in the latanoprost arm and 2.6 +/- 2.1 mm Hg and 2.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg in the timolol arm at 6 and 12 weeks after the start of the follow-up, respectively. In the latanoprost group, bunazosin provided a further reduction of intraocular pressure (7.7%) at 12 weeks from that initially obtained at 2 weeks (P = 0.0377). In the placebo subgroups of the latanoprost and timolol arms, no significant change was found between at baseline and at any visit after the start of the follow-up. In the latanoprost and timolol arms, there was a significant difference in intraocular pressure and its change between the bunazosin subgroup and placebo subgroup at any visit after 4 weeks from the start of the follow-up (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Bunazosin hydrochloride 0.01% may provide an additional intraocular pressure reduction in patients already receiving latanoprost or timolol. Since adding bunazosin to eyes treated with latanoprost caused a relatively small hypotensive response at 2 weeks and provided a further reduction from 2 weeks to 12 weeks, longer than 4 weeks may be required to evaluate a clinically meaningful response to treatment. Further investigation on more cases and longer follow-up are needed."

METHODS: A three-center, randomized, double-masked study where IOP, conjunctival hyperemia, and ocular irritation were followed during a 1-month twice-daily treatment with placebo or 35, 60, or 115 micrograms/ml PhXA41 in 60 patients with ocular hypertension, primary open-angle glaucoma, or capsular glaucoma. RESULTS: The three concentrations of PhXA41 reduced the average IOP between 31% and 38% during the second day of treatment, with only a weak dose-response relationship. The initial effect declined somewhat during the first 2 weeks of treatment but then remained at the same level for the rest of the study, with a pressure reduction of approximately 20% for all three concentrations. On the second day of treatment, mild conjunctival hyperemia could be observed in most treated patients. Nineteen of 45 PhXA41-treated patients, compared with 2 of 15 placebo-treated patients, reported to have mild to moderate ocular irritation. These side effects became less pronounced during the study, and at the end there was little difference in the degree of conjunctival hyperemia between placebo- and drug-treated eyes, and no drug-related ocular irritation was reported with the two lowest concentrations of PhXA41. CONCLUSIONS: It is confirmed that the PGF2 alpha analog PhXA41 is a major improvement with respect to the effect-side effect relationship and that it may become a valuable new agent for the treatment of glaucoma.

METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, double masked, parallel study on 30 patients with OAG. All patients received 4 weeks of timolol treatment prior to randomization to LTFC or DTFC treatment. Measurements after randomization were taken at 1, 6, and 12 months, including arterial blood pressure; IOP; color Doppler imaging of the ophthalmic artery (OA), central retinal artery, and short posterior ciliary artery (SPCA); scanning laser polarimetry; Humphrey visual field examination; and adverse events. RESULTS: IOP decreased by 5.0 mmHg in the DTFC cohort (p<0.000) and 5.44 mmHg in the LTFC cohort (p=0.0001) after 12 months of treatment. No statistically significant differences in visual field or nerve fiber layer thickness were observed between the treatment groups during 12 months of therapy. Mean increase over 1 year of treatment in ocular perfusion and diastolic perfusion pressures were 10.46% and 10.67% in the DTFC group and 7.47% and 5.61% in the LTFC group, respectively. OA resistive index (RI) and SPCA RI were significantly different at the 12 months visit between the two treatment groups (p=0.05 and p=0.000, respectively): DTFC treatment showed decrease in the RI. CONCLUSIONS: One year of treatment with LTFC or DTFC resulted in similar IOP lowering effects as well as stable visual function and structure.

Combined data from a 12-month completed study and 6-month interim data from an ongoing study are reported. Efficacy and safety were evaluated at baseline, weeks 1 and 2, and months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at peak (2 hours after the morning dose) and trough (12 hours after the evening dose). Patients (n = 926) instilled either brimonidine tartrate 0.2% or timolol maleate 0.5% twice daily.

Nevertheless it is well known that sometimes ocular hypertension does not lead to fullyfledged glaucoma. In this study patients with simple ocular hypertension were followed with some of the most sensitive techniques available to detect early glaucomatous damage. The aim of the study was to see whether treatment with beta-blockers had any effect on development of ocular hypertension toward fullyfledged glaucoma. 26 patients, 14 males and 12 females, with a mean age of 60 years were studied. All had simple ocular hypertension, without any alteration of the visual field, pattern ERG and optic nerve head morphology; their visual acuity was 1.0, while no other ocular pathologies or specific risk factors for primary open-angle glaucoma (familiarity, diabetes, etc.) was present. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: one group was treated with levobunolol 0.5% 1 drop twice daily in both eyes, while the other group underwent no treatment. Visual acuity and IOP measurements, automated perimetry and pattern-ERG were performed at the onset, than after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months; optic disk stereoscopic photography was repeated only after 12 and 18 months. The data underwent a statistical analysis with t-test for paired data.

"Purpose: We compared differences associated with use of travoprost and latanoprost on both progression of perimetric loss over time and associated costs among black patients. Methods: Patients with primary open-angle glaucome or ocular hypertension were randomly assigned to one of four arms in a 12-month, double-masked study: travoprost (0.004% or 0.0015%), latanoprost (0.005%), or timolol (0.5%). Forty-nine patients received 0.004% travoprost, 43 received latanoprost, and 40 received timolol. We applied algorithms found in published studies that link intraocular pressure (IOP) control to visual field progression and calculated the likelihood of visual field deterioration based on IOP data. This was used to estimate differences in medical care costs. Results: The average IOP was lower for patients receiving travoprost than for patients receiving latanoprost or timolol (17.3 versus 18.7 versus 20.5 mm Hg respectively, P<.05). Travoprost-treated patients had a smaller predicted change in visual field defect score (VFDS) than latanoprost-treated patients and timolol-treated patients, and significantly fewer were expected to demonstrate visual field progression. Medical care costs would be higher for latanoprost-treated and timolol-treated patients. Conclusions: Recent studies have provided algorithms linking IOP control to changes in visual fields. We found that treatment with travoprost was associated with less visual field progression and potential cost savings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, randomized, masked-evaluator, parallel-group, multicenter study in the United States included patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Patients received latanoprost 0.005% once daily (8:00 AM; n = 152) or brimonidine tartrate 0.2% twice daily (8:00 AM and 8:00 PM; n = 151). Patients underwent evaluation at screening, baseline (randomization), and after 0.5, 3, and 6 months of treatment. IOP was measured at 8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, noon, and 4:00 PM at baseline and the months 3 and 6 visits, and at 8:00 AM only at week 2. The main outcome measure was the difference in diurnal IOP change from baseline to month 6 between treatment groups. Adverse events were recorded at each visit. RESULTS: Baseline mean diurnal IOP levels were similar between groups. At month 6, the adjusted mean (+/- SEM) diurnal IOP reduction was 5.7 +/- 0.3 mm Hg in the latanoprost group and 3.1 +/- 0.3 mm Hg in patients receiving brimonidine (P < 0.001). The mean difference in diurnal IOP reduction was 2.5 +/- 0.3 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.9, 3.2; P < 0.001). Five times more patients receiving brimonidine than latanoprost were withdrawn from the study due to adverse events. CONCLUSION: Latanoprost instilled once daily is more effective and better tolerated than brimonidine administered twice daily for the treatment of patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. During therapy, the range of daily fluctuation of IOP is less for latanoprost compared with brimonidine.

METHODS: Sixty newly diagnosed patients with POAG or OHT were randomly assigned to travoprost 0.004% (n = 12 with POAG, n = 8 with OHT), latanoprost 0.005% (n = 11 with POAG, n = 9 with OHT) and bimatoprost 0.03% (n = 13 with POAG, n = 7 with OHT) treatment groups in a double-masked fashion. At baseline examination, blood pressure, heart rate and intraocular pressure (IOP) were recorded. Peak-systolic and end-diastolic velocities were measured in the ophthalmic (OA), central retinal (CRA) and temporal short posterior ciliary arteries (PCA). The resistive index (RI) and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) were determined for each treatment group. After a treatment period of 6-months, all procedures were repeated. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age (53 +/- 14 years in the travoprost group, 51 +/- 14 years in the latanoprost group, 53 +/- 11 years in the bimatoprost group), gender (11 men, nine women; 11 men, nine women; 13 men, seven women, by group, respectively), or clinical diagnosis (POAG or OHT) among treatment groups (p > 0.05).

METHODS: After a 2 week timolol run in, patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomised (1:1) to receive treatment with either the dorzolamide/timolol combination solution twice daily (combination) or the dorzolamide solution twice daily plus timolol maleate solution twice daily (concomitant) for 3 months. RESULTS: 299 patients were entered and 290 patients completed the study. Compared with the timolol baseline, additional IOP lowering of 16% was observed at trough (hour 0) and 22% at peak (hour 2) at month 3 in both the concomitant and combination groups. The IOP lowering effects of the two treatment groups were clinically and statistically equivalent as demonstrated by the extremely small point differences (concomitant--combination) observed in this study--0.01 mm Hg at trough and 0.08 mm Hg at peak. The safety variables of the concomitant and combination groups were very similar. Both combination and concomitant therapy were well tolerated and few patients discontinued due to adverse effects.

METHODS: Eight hundred one patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomly assigned to travoprost 0.0015%, travoprost 0.004%, latanoprost 0.005%, or timolol 0.5%. The efficacy and safety of travoprost (0.0015% and 0.004%) daily was compared with latanoprost daily and timolol twice daily for a period of 12 months. RESULTS: Travoprost was equal or superior to latanoprost and superior to timolol with mean intraocular pressure over visits and time of day ranging from 17.9 to 19.1 mm Hg (travoprost 0.0015%), 17.7 to 19.1 mm Hg (travoprost 0.004%), 18.5 to 19.2 mm Hg (latanoprost), and 19.4 to 20.3 mm Hg (timolol). For all visits pooled, the mean intraocular pressure at 4 PM for travoprost was 0.7 mm Hg (0.0015%, P =.0502) and 0.8 mm Hg (0.004%, P =.0191) lower than for latanoprost. Travoprost 0.004% was more effective than latanoprost and timolol in reducing intraocular pressure in black patients by up to 2.4 mm Hg (versus latanoprost) and 4.6 mm Hg (versus timolol). Based on a criterion of 30% or greater intraocular pressure reduction from diurnal baseline or intraocular pressure 17 mm Hg or less, travoprost 0.0015% and 0.004% had an overall response to treatment of 49.3% and 54.7%, respectively, compared with 49.6% for latanoprost and 39.0% for timolol. Iris pigmentation change was observed in 10 of 201 of patients (5.0%) receiving travoprost 0.0015%, six of 196 of patients (3.1%) receiving travoprost 0.004%, 10 of 194 of patients (5.2%) receiving latanoprost, and none of the patients receiving timolol (0 of 196). The average ocular hyperemia score was less than 1 on a scale of 0 to 3, indicating that on average patients experienced between none/trace and mild for all treatment groups. There were no serious, unexpected, related adverse events reported for any therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Travoprost (0.0015% and 0.004%), a highly selective, potent prostaglandin F (FP) receptor agonist, is equal or superior to latanoprost and superior to timolol in lowering intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In addition, travoprost 0.004% is significantly better than either latanoprost or timolol in lowering intraocular pressure in black patients.

DESIGN: Prospective, crossover, double-masked comparison. METHODS: After a 6-week medicine-free period, 33 patients were randomized to receive travoprost dosed in the morning or evening. After 8 weeks of treatment, a 24-hour IOP curve was performed at 6 am, 10 am, 2 pm, 6 pm, 10 pm, and 2 am. Patients were then treated with the opposite dosing regimen for another 8 weeks, after which the 24-hour IOP curve was repeated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Twenty-four-hour IOP. RESULTS: The untreated mean 24-hour IOP was 23.6+/-2.0 mmHg. There were no differences for mean 24-hour IOP between the morning (17.5+/-1.9 mmHg) and evening (17.3+/-1.9 mmHg) dosings (P = 0.7). At 10 am, the evening dosing provided a statistically lower IOP (17.2+/-2.1 mmHg) than the morning dosing (19.1+/-2.5 mmHg) (P = 0.02). Evening dosing demonstrated a statistically lower 24-hour fluctuation of IOP (3.2+/-1.0 mmHg) than morning dosing (4.0+/-1.5 mmHg) (P = 0.01). Safety was similar, with conjunctival hyperemia being the most common adverse event (n = 9 [27% for morning dosing] and n = 11 [33% for evening dosing], P = 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that both morning and evening dosings of travoprost provide effective 24-hour IOP reduction. However, the evening dosing of travoprost demonstrates slightly greater daytime efficacy, with a narrower range of 24-hour pressure.

The results are taken from an ongoing 6 year follow-up study of glaucoma suspects randomly selected for treatment and nontreatment. We present fine-grid meridional data, recorded every 4 months by automated perimetry, of all 46 patients (24 treated and 22 untreated) who completed the 6 year follow-up without developing localized visual field defects, acquired optis disc changes and whose IOP was not judged clinically dangerous during the follow-up. Methods of analyzing the profile sensitivity, the profile slope and the sensitivity of specific locations over the follow-up are described. The results show that the long-term fluctuation in differential light sensitivity in the two groups was not significantly different (P = 0.395) and that the sensitivity at most of the locations remained stable. The number of stable locations was not significantly different in the two groups (P = 0.412) and there was also no difference in the number of locations where the sensitivity appeared to decrease (P = 0.193) or increase (P = 0.540). Analysis of covariance showed no group difference in the profile sensitivity or the profile slope and that these variables remained stable in both groups over the 6 year period. Although the treated group maintained a consistently lower IOP than the untreated controls, our results showed that long-term pressure reduction with timolol in glaucoma suspects appeared not to influence the differential light sensitivity in the tested meridian."

DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of Xalatan/Lumigan/Travatan study data, a masked-evaluator, randomized, parallel-group comparison of 12-week efficacy of latanoprost, bimatoprost, and travoprost in open-angle glaucoma/ocular hypertension patients. METHODS: Pretreatment inter-visit IOP range defined as highest IOP minus lowest IOP at screening, safety check, and baseline (six measurements); posttreatment inter-visit IOP range defined as highest IOP minus lowest IOP at weeks two, six, and 12 or early termination (nine measurements). Ranges dichotomized as ""high"" (>6 mm Hg) vs ""low"" (< or =6 mm Hg). RESULTS: Included were 410 patients (latanoprost, 136; bimatoprost, 136; travoprost, 138). Each resulted in significant mean IOP range reductions during 12 weeks. Pretreatment inter-visit IOP range was associated with African-American race, male gender, and presence of visual field defect (P < .05 for all). Percentages with high pretreatment inter-visit IOP ranges were comparable across treatments (63% to 64%). High posttreatment inter-visit IOP range was seen in 21% (28/136), 28% (38/136), and 36% (50/138) of latanoprost, bimatoprost, and travoprost groups, respectively (P = .016, overall; P = .005, latanoprost vs travoprost). High posttreatment inter-visit IOP range was associated with African-American race, high pretreatment inter-visit IOP range, and treatment with travoprost vs latanoprost (P < .05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Given that high inter-visit IOP range is associated with risk factors for glaucomatous damage and that such differences cannot be evaluated using mean IOPs, inter-visit IOP range may be another useful approach to assessing IOP control in clinical trials.

DESIGN: Randomized, double-masked, parallel group, multicenter equivalence study. PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred forty-two patients randomized to the study treatments. METHODS: Patients with OAG or OHT and with qualifying IOP (22-36 mmHg at 8 am on 2 eligibility visits after an appropriate washout period from previous treatment) were assigned randomly to either brimonidine tartrate 0.15% preserved with polyquaternium-1 (brimonidine PQ) or brimonidine tartrate 0.15% preserved with chlorine dioxide (brimonidine P) dosed 3 times daily and were followed up for 6 months. Approximately one half of the study sites continued to follow up their patients for an additional 6 months to obtain longer-term safety data. RESULTS: Brimonidine PQ produced statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions from baseline ranging from 4.3 to 6.5 mmHg, which were statistically and clinically equivalent to brimonidine P at all 18 visit days and times. No safety concerns were identified based on an assessment of ocular and cardiovascular parameters.

METHODS: The study was a randomized, parallel group, double-masked, multicenter comparison between latanoprost and timolol in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, followed by an open-label 18-month extension during which all patients were treated with latanoprost. RESULTS: Latanoprost caused a marked and sustained reduction of the intraocular pressure (IOP). IOP was reduced from baseline levels 25.1+/-3.5 mm Hg (mean+/-SD) in 183 patients initially randomized to treatment with latanoprost to 17.4+/-2.9 mm Hg (n=66) after 24 months of treatment. For patients initially randomized to treatment with timolol the corresponding figures were 24.3+/-2.3 mm Hg (n=72) and 17.4+/-2.6 (n=41) mm Hg after 18 months of treatment with latanoprost. Two patients were withdrawn because of uncontrolled IOP and 11 patients required additional timolol treatment to maintain an adequate IOP control. Patients initially treated with timolol and switched to latanoprost had a further reduction of the IOP of 1.0 mm Hg after 6 months of treatment with latanoprost (p<0.005). 46 patients were withdrawn from the study, mostly due to increased iris pigmentation or an iris color with known high risk of developing increased pigmentation. 22 patients developed increased pigmentation of the iris. The follow-up revealed no previously unknown ocular or systemic side effects. CONCLUSION: Once daily applications of latanoprost cause a marked and sustained reduction of the IOP.

Methods: Masked randomized prospective trial. This study included 51 patients (64 eyes) with newly diagnosed glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The cases were randomly divided into two treatment groups for administration of latanoprost 0.005% once daily, or of carteolol 2% twice daily and pilocarpine 2% twice daily. Mean diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at baseline, week 2, week 4, and month 3 after the beginning of treatment. Changes in mean IOP from baseline to the 3-month visit were determined by an analysis of variance. Results: Mean diurnal IOP values were 25.1 +/- 3.1 mm Hg and 25.5 +/- 2.5 mm Hg at baseline in the latanoprost monotherapy group and in the carteolol-plus-pilocarpine group, respectively. Diurnal IOP was significantly decreased from baseline to 3 months in both groups (P < .001). At this time point, latanoprost monotherapy had reduced mean diurnal IOP by 7.2 +/- 2.5 mm Hg (28.7%) and carteolol plus pilocarpine had reduced mean diurnal IOP by 7.4 +/- 2.7 mm Hg (29%). There was no difference between the groups in terms of their IOP reduction effect (P = .51). Decreased visual acuity and twilight vision, blurred vision, and headache were more frequent in the carteolol-plus-pilocarpine group than in the latanoprost group (P < .05).

Effect of dorzolamide and timolol on ocular blood flow in patients with primary open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension	British Journal of Ophthalmology	Br.J.Ophthalmol.	2005	89	10	1293	1297	"BACKGROUND: There is evidence that perfusion abnormalities of the optic nerve head are involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. There is therefore considerable interest in the effects of topical antiglaucoma drugs on ocular blood flow. A study was undertaken to compare the ocular haemodynamic effects of dorzolamide and timolol in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). METHODS: One hundred and forty patients with POAG or OHT were included in a controlled, randomised, double blind study in two parallel groups; 70 were randomised to receive timolol and 70 to receive dorzolamide for a period of 6 months. Subjects whose intraocular pressure (IOP) did not respond to either of the two drugs were switched to the alternative treatment after 2 weeks. Scanning laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure blood flow in the temporal neuroretinal rim and the cup of the optic nerve head. Pulsatile choroidal blood flow was assessed using laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation amplitude. RESULTS: Five patients did not respond to timolol and were changed to the dorzolamide group, and 18 patients changed from dorzolamide treatment to timolol. The effects of both drugs on IOP and ocular perfusion pressure were comparable. Dorzolamide, but not timolol, increased blood flow in the temporal neuroretinal rim (8.5 (1.6)%, p<0.001 versus timolol) and the cup of the optic nerve head (13.5 (2.5)%, p<0.001 versus timolol), and fundus pulsation amplitude (8.9 (1.3)%, p<0.001 versus timolol). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates augmented blood flow in the optic nerve head and choroid after 6 months of treatment with dorzolamide, but not with timolol. It remains to be established whether this effect can help to reduce visual field loss in patients with glaucoma.

Twenty-four-hour diurnal curve comparison of commercially available latanoprost 0.005% Versus the timolol and dorzolamide fixed combination	Ophthalmology	Ophthalmology	2003	110	7	1357	1360	"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of commercially available latanoprost 0.005% given every evening versus timolol 0.5% and dorzolamide 2% fixed combination (TDFC) given twice daily to white Greeks with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertensive patients. DESIGN: A single-masked, two-center, crossover comparison with two 6-week treatment periods occurring after at least a 3-week medicine-free period. Diurnal curve intraocular pressures were taken at 2:00 AM, 6:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 6:00 PM, and 10:00 PM. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS: Latanoprost 0.005% given every evening and TDFC twice daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy variable was diurnal intraocular pressure. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients completed the study. On the last day of treatment, the mean diurnal intraocular pressure for latanoprost was 15.9 +/- 2.3 mmHg and for TDFC was 15.3 +/- 2.0 mmHg (P = 0.05). Individual time points for intraocular pressure were not statistically different between groups except at the 10:00 PM time point, when the mean for TDFC was 14.6 +/- 2.7 mmHg and for latanoprost was 16.6 +/- 3.1 mmHg (P < 0.006). Eighteen patients overall preferred latanoprost versus 2 patients for the fixed combination, generally because of the greater convenience of once daily dosing. Adverse events were not significantly different between groups except that a bitter taste was found more frequently with TDFC (n = 9) than with latanoprost (n = 0; P = 0.009). Despite screening to exclude intolerance to beta-blockers, a single patient had to discontinue the TDFC because of new-onset asthma. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the 24-hour diurnal intraocular pressure is lowered more, by a small but statistically significant amount, with TDFC compared with latanoprost in primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertensive patients.

Prostaglandin analogs and blood-aqueous barrier integrity: a flare cell meter study	Ophthalmologica	Ophthalmologica	2004	218	5	312	317	"PURPOSE: To study, with an objective method, inflammation of the anterior segment of the glaucomatous eye after treatment with latanoprost, travoprost and bimatoprost. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma aged between 38 and 76 years (mean 64.0 +/- 12.2) were randomly assigned to latanoprost 0.005, travoprost 0.004 and bimatoprost 0.03%. The study period lasted 6 months. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured every 2 weeks. We studied the intraocular inflammation before and after 3 and 6 months of therapy with an instrument composed of a He-Ne laser beam system, a photomultiplier mounted on a slitlamp microscope and a computer. This flare meter allows objective determination of the flare and the number of cells in the aqueous of the anterior chamber. RESULTS: At the baseline, IOP was 26.4 +/- 3.6 mm Hg. After 3 months of treatment, mean IOP in the latanoprost group was 17.9 +/- 0.3 mm Hg (p < 0.001) with a mean cellularity of 12.638 +/- 3.284 photons/ms (p < 0.001). The travoprost group had an IOP of 17.2 +/- 0.3 mm Hg (p < 0.001) with a cellularity of 9.719 +/- 1.927 photons/ms (0.001). Finally, IOP in the bimatoprost group was 17.6 +/- 0.5 mm Hg (p < 0.001) with a cellularity of 6.138 +/- 1.475 photons/ms (p < 0.032). After 6 months of treatment, IOP in the latanoprost group was 18.1 +/- 0.3 (p < 0.001), in the travoprost group 17.3 +/- 0.3 (p < 0.001) and in the bimatoprost group 17.7 +/- 0.5 mm Hg (p < 0.001), whereas cellularity was 11.838 +/- 3.218 (p < 0.001), 8.950 +/- 3.692 (p < 0.001) and 7.617 +/- 2.603 photons/ms (p < 0.001), respectively. After 3 months, the travoprost (p < 0.013) and the bimatoprost groups (p < 0.001) had less flare compared with the latanoprost group and this remained so even at 6 months. When we compared the travoprost group with the bimatoprost group, we found significantly less flare at 3 months in the bimatoprost group (p < 0.001) but not at 6 months (p < 0.246). CONCLUSIONS: The flare meter analysis shows that the eyes treated with bimatoprost and travoprost have a less significantly broken blood-aqueous barrier and their anterior chamber is also significantly less inflamed.

This was a prospective, examiner masked, randomised and crossover study. Participants were 32 consecutive subjects, who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, with newly diagnosed OAG. Patients were randomised to either LTFC or DTFC for the first 1-month treatment phase after a 1-month washout period, without medical treatment, patients began with the opposite treatment for the second 1-month treatment period. Colour Doppler parameters in ophthalmic artery (OA) and posterior ciliary arteries (PCA), ocular perfusion pressure, IOP and systemic haemodynamics were assessed at each baseline and at the end of each treatment period. The main outcomes include peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV) and resistance index (RI) in OA and PCA. DTFC significantly increased EDV in OA from 7.55 (1.16) to 9.32 (1.22), p<0.0001, and in the PCA from 4.41 (0.70) to 5.36 (0.60), p<0.0001, and significantly decreased RI in OA from 0.775 (0.036) to 0.725 (0.032), p<0.0001, and in the PCA from 0.694 (0.045) to 0.634 (0.034). LTFC significantly decreased the EDV and significantly increased RI in PCA, p=0.0076 and p=0.0009, respectively. There were no statistical significant differences in the IOP lowering effect between both treatments. DTFC seems to have a beneficial vascular effect on retrobulbar vessels in OAG patients."

Methods: Multicentre, double masked, randomised, parallel group, 3 month trial comparing bimatoprost once daily (n=240), bimatoprost twice daily (n=240), and timolol twice daily (n=122). The primary efficacy end point was diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) (8 am, 10 am, 4 pm). Safety measures included adverse events, ocular parameters, and systemic variables. Results: Bimatoprost once daily provided significantly lower mean IOP than timolol twice daily at all times and follow up visits (p<0.001). At month 3, mean IOP reductions from baseline at 10 am (peak timolol effect) were bimatoprost once daily, 8.0 mm Hg (32.4%); bimatoprost twice daily, 6.3 mm Hg (25.2%); timolol, 5.5 mm Hg (22.7%). Bimatoprost twice daily was also more effective than timolol, but was not as effective as bimatoprost once daily. A higher percentage of patients achieved low target pressures with bimatoprost once daily than with timolol. The most frequent side effects with bimatoprost were eyelash growth and mild conjunctival hyperaemia. Systemic safety parameters were not affected by bimatoprost. Conclusions: Bimatoprost 0.03% once daily demonstrated superior efficacy compared with timolol 0.5% twice daily in patients with elevated IOP. Bimatoprost once daily was more effective than twice daily dosing."

This randomized double-blind study comprised 34 consecutive patients with open-angle glaucoma, already treated with either timolol alone or in combination with other antiglaucoma agents. The patients were randomly allocated to receive either betaxolol (n = 17) or timolol (n = 17) instead of the present timolol drops. Additional antiglaucoma therapy remained unchanged. The retinal blood flow was assessed by scanning laser Doppler flowmetry and the pulsatile choroidal blood flow was assessed by laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation amplitude. Ocular blood flow measurement as well as systemic hemodynamic and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed at baseline and 1 week and 1 and 3 months after the therapy change. Visual field testing was performed at baseline and at 3 months. After 3 months of treatment with either timolol or betaxolol, neither the retinal nor the pulsatile choroidal blood flow were significantly altered. The power to detect a 9% change in pulsatile choroidal blood flow and a 20% change in retinal blood flow in the present study was 90%. The IOP was not significantly altered in either group. In contrast, visual fields slightly improved after betaxolol treatment compared to baseline (p = 0.047), but this effect was not significant versus timolol.

DESIGN: Prospective multicenter, randomized, double-masked, crossover comparison study. METHODS: Primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension patients were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups for a 6-week treatment period and then crossed over to the opposite treatment. Diurnal curve testing was performed at 8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 4:00 PM, 6:00 PM, and 8:00 PM at baseline and the end of each treatment period. The run-in medicine was timolol twice daily for 28 days. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients completed this trial. The baseline trough pressure was 24.3 +/- 3.0 mm Hg, and the diurnal curve was 23.4 +/- 3.2 mm Hg. For the fixed combination the treatment trough pressure was 20.8 +/- 4.1 mm Hg and the diurnal curve was 19.6 +/- 3.6 mm Hg, whereas timolol and unoprostone concomitant therapy showed a treatment trough pressure of 20.1 +/- 4.5 mm Hg and a diurnal pressure of 19.8 +/- 4.1 mm Hg. There was no significant difference between treatment groups at any time point, for the diurnal curve, or in the extended reduction from baseline. There was no difference between treatment groups regarding ocular and systemic unsolicited or solicited adverse events. Burning, stinging, and conjunctival hyperemia were the adverse events most noted. There were no serious adverse events during this trial.

METHODS:The study population was composed of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (including pseudoexfoliation) or ocular hypertension. After washout of antiglaucoma medications, intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at 0, + 2, + 8, and + 12 hours. Patients were randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to unoprostone, timolol, or betaxolol. Patients returned for examinations at 2 and 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: 556 patients were randomized. Each drug produced a clinically and statistically (P <.001) significant reduction from baseline in 12-hour diurnal IOP at month 6 (- 4.3 mm Hg, unoprostone; - 5.8 mm Hg, timolol; - 4.9 mm Hg, betaxolol). Differences in adjusted treatment means between unoprostone and timolol and unoprostone and betaxolol were 1.57 mm Hg (95% CI: 1.00, 2.13) and 0.53 mm Hg (95% CI: - 0.03, 1.09), respectively. Unoprostone was clinically equivalent to betaxolol but did not have as great an IOP-lowering effect as timolol. Discontinued for inadequate control of IOP were 7%, 1%, and 4% of the patients for unoprostone, timolol, and betaxolol, respectively. There were no changes of note in visual acuity, pupil size, cup-to-disk ratio, visual fields, or iris color. Changes in heart rate and blood pressure were small, with no clinically significant differences between groups.

After using timolol maleate 0.5% monotherapy twice a day for 2 weeks, patients (n = 146) with an early morning intraocular pressure (IOP) between 22 and 28 mm Hg, inclusively, received unoprostone isopropyl 0.15% (n = 50), brimonidine tartrate 0.2% (n = 48), or dorzolamide hydrochloride 2.0% (n = 48) twice daily as adjunctive therapy to timolol maleate 0.5% for another 12 weeks. Safety was based on comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, adverse events, and vital signs. Efficacy was based on mean change from baseline in the 8 hour diurnal IOP at week 12. Baseline was defined as values obtained after 2 weeks of timolol monotherapy. RESULTS: Each drug was safe and well tolerated. Burning/stinging was the most common treatment emergent adverse event. No clinically relevant changes from baseline were observed for any ophthalmic examination or vital signs.

Participants: Three hundred sixty-nine subjects with bilateral ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma who had a baseline central corneal endothelial cell density of at least 1500 cells/mm2, central corneal thickness of less than 0.68 mm, no corneal pathologic condition on slit-lamp examination, and intraocular pressure of less than 22 mmHg after a 3-week run-in on timolol, 0.5%, once daily were included. Intervention: Subjects were randomly assigned to treatment with latanoprost 0.005% (n = 127), fixed-combination latanoprost 0.005%-timolol 0.5% (FC, n = 116), or timolol 0.5% (n = 126) one drop, once daily in the morning for 1 year. All subjects were treated in both eyes. Specular microscopy and ultrasonic pachymetry were performed before treatment, and after 6 and 12 months of treatment. Main Outcome Measures: Mean percent change in central endothelial cell density and central corneal thickness after 1 year of treatment. Results: For both corneal endothelial cell density and corneal thickness, the mean percent changes from baseline were similar in all three treatment groups. Mean percent endothelial cell change at 1 year from baseline for latanoprost, FC, and timolol was 0.3 +/- 2.2%, 0.1 +/- 1.8%, 0.0 +/- 2.5% (mean +/- standard deviation; 95% confidence interval: latanoprost vs timolol -0.2-1.0; FC vs timolol -0.4-0.7) and mean percent change in corneal thickness was -1.1 +/- 2.5%, -1.0 +/- 2.0%, 0.2 +/- 3.1%, respectively.

Methods: This was a double-masked, randomized, parallel group, multi-site study in patients (pts) with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Qualifying pts, whose entry IOP was 22-36 mmHg at 8 am on 2 separate eligibility visits, were randomized to receive Trav/Tim in the am (n=155) or Tim in the am plus Trav in the pm (n=151) or Tim am + pm (n=81). Mean IOP was measured at 8 am, 10 am, & 4 pm on follow-up treatment visits at Week 2, Week 6, & Month 3. Statistical analyses were based on ANOVA using SAS for Windows 8.2. Results: Mean baseline IOP in the per-protocol data set ranged across the day 23.1-25.6 mmHg (Trav/Tim), 22.9-25.0 mmHg (Trav+Tim), & 22.9-25.4 mmHg (Tim). Mean IOP reductions from baseline produced by Trav/Tim ranged 6.8-8.6 mmHg (p~50.0001), by Trav+Tim ranged 7.3-8.4 mmHg (p' 0.0001), & by Tim ranged 4.6-7.0 mmHg (p:50.0001). Trav/Tim reduced diurnal mean IOP in a fashion similar to Trav+Tim, with differences in mean IOP change ranging 0.1-1.0 mmHg between the two groups (0.0126:5p:50.8955). 2 of 9 time points showed significantly greater IOP reduction by concomitant Trav+Tim (p:S 0.0185).

METHODS: Thirty-seven patients were included in this randomized, double-masked, parallel group study. Patients received either latanoprost 0.005% (n= 18) or timolol 0.5% (n= 19) instilled once daily in the morning for a treatment period of 27 days. Routine ophthalmic examinations, including intraocular pressure measurement, as well as tests to evaluate tear fluid and the ocular surface were performed. RESULTS: After one drop of medication, tear secretion was significantly reduced by timolol, but not by latanoprost. At the end of the study the break-up time (BUT) was significantly decreased in the timolol group but not in the latanoprost group. The BUT still remained in the normal range in both groups, although it is important to note that timolol was administered at half the clinical dose. Both latanoprost and timolol tended to increase Rose-Bengal staining of the cornea and conjunctiva after one month of treatment but no statistically significant difference was found between the groups.

"Effects of travoprost 0.004% Ophthalmic solution, six weeks after its laminated packaging had been removed, in primary open-angle glaucoma: a randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded study"	Clinical therapeutics	Clin.Ther.	2004	26	12	2121	2127	"BACKGROUND: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a chronic and progressive optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer neuropathy, with characteristic visual field damage. The intraocular pressure (IOP) is typically higher than the level considered statistically normal. Although there is no known cure, appropriate reduction of IOP with hypotensive drugs (eg, the topical prostaglandin analogue travoprost) delays the progression of POAG. Chemical-stability studies of travoprost performed by the manufacturer suggest that the stability of travoprost is maintained beyond the expiration date, which is 6 weeks after the laminated packaging has been opened. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of travoprost 0.004% ophthalmic solution, 6 to 12 weeks after its expiration date, in patients with POAG. METHODS: This randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded study was conducted at 2 centers in Brazil: the Ophthalmology Department, Federal University of Goias, Goiania, and the Ophthalmology Department, Santa Casa de Misericordia Hospital in Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo. Patients with POAG (in 1 or both eyes) were randomly assigned to receive travoprost, either from a bottle from which the laminated packaging had been removed and that had been stored at room light and temperature for 6 weeks (ie, after the expiration date; opened group), or from a bottle that had been sealed until first use by the patient (control group). Drug was to be administered, 1 drop in the lower conjunctival sac (in the affected eye[s]), QD between 7 pm and 9 pm, for 6 weeks. IOP was measured at study weeks 0 (baseline), 4, and 6. The 2 treatment groups were compared with regard to hypotensor effect and incidence of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS:: Thirty-one patients completed the study (55 eyes; 28 right and 27 left eyes; 35 eyes of women, 20 eyes of men). The mean (SD) ages of the opened and control groups were 61.8 (13.5) and 62.8 (14.1) years, respectively. Twenty-four patients were included in both treatment groups (ie, 1 eye per group). The baseline IOP was similar between the 2 treatment groups. There was a significant reduction in IOP in both groups at 4 and 6 weeks (both, P < 0.001 vs baseline). However, no significant differences in IOP were found between the 2 treatment groups at any time during the study. Conjunctive hyperemia and a burning sensation in the eye immediately after application were the only AEs reported; the incidence of these was similar between the 2 treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of patients with POAG, IOPs and AEs were similar in eyes receiving 6 weeks of treatment with travoprost 0.004% ophthalmic solution, either from bottles from which the laminated packaging had been opened and that had been stored at room light and temperature for 6 weeks (ie, after the expiration date), or from bottles that had been sealed until first use by the patient. These results suggest that travoprost remains effective for at least 12 weeks after the laminated packaging has been opened.

Long-term effect of ophthalmic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on intraocular pressure and retinal sensitivity in primary open-angle glaucoma	Current eye research	Curr.Eye Res.	1992	11	1	1	3	"Timolol (TIM) and betaxolol (BET) were evaluated for their effects on both intraocular pressure and retinal sensitivity as determined from visual fields in a randomized two-year parallel study in 20 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. All treatments were twice-daily in both eyes. TIM was more effective than BET as an ocular hypotensive agent throughout the two year period. With regard to retinal sensitivity as measured by automated visual fields, there was a decrease in retinal sensitivity in the first six months in the TIM and BET treatment groups by 0.5-0.6 dB, and 0.2-0.3 dB, respectively. However, at the one and two year visits, retinal sensitivity increased 0.8-0.9 dB in the BET treatment group only. It appears that ocular hypotensive efficacy may not relate to retinal sensitivity within a period of two years or less in patients with mildly to moderately elevated intraocular pressure. Further work may reveal the reliability of this observation, and its clinical relevance."

"The purpose of this study was to compare the ocular effect and safety of a 0.5% ophthalmic solution of MK-507 (generic name, dorzolamide hydrochloride), a newly developed carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, with timolol maleate 0.25% ophthalmic solution (timolol) as an active control drug in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. A total of 245 patients were topically given MK-507 three times a day or timolol twice a day for 12 weeks each, by random allocation. Both groups showed significant reduction in intraocular pressure throughout the 12 weeks. Outflow pressure mean reduction rate (A%) from week 8 to week 12 was 20% or more in 75.2% (85/113) and 80.4% (90/112) of the MK-507 and timolol groups, respectively. Side effects were reported in 8 patients (10 events) of the MK-507 group, mainly temporary smarting at instillation, with no systemic side effects. On the other hand, 8 patients (20 events) of the timolol group reported local or systemic side effects, though none were serious. No abnormal change in any item of examination was reported. The results suggest that MK-507 0.5% has an efficacy equivalent to timolol 0.25% in terms of intraocular pressure control, and is free from the systemic side effects often observed in treatment with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, indicating that it could be a promising antiglaucoma agent.

Methods: This randomized, parallel-group study was conducted at 45 U.S. sites over 12 weeks. Previously treated OAG or OH patients with an IOP =23 mmHg in one or two eyes after washout received latanoprost 0.005%, bimatoprost 0.03%, or travoprost 0.004% once daily (evening). At baseline and Weeks 6 and 12, IOP was measured in triplicate by masked evaluators at 8:00 AM, noon, 4:00 PM, and 8:00 PM, and conjunctival hyperemia was graded by masked investigators before the 8:00 AM IOP measurement. Change between baseline and Week 12 in 8:00 AM IOP measurements (time of peak drug effect) was the primary efficacy outcome. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses included 410/411 randomized patients (latanoprost, 136; bimatoprost 136; travoprost, 138). Baseline mean 8:00 AM IOP levels were similar (P=0.772; approximately 26 mmHg in each treatment group); significant (P<0.001) reductions were observed in all three groups at Week 12. Mean (&plusmn;SEM) IOP reductions at 8:00 AM were equivalent based on ANCOVA: latanoprost, 8.6&plusmn;0.3 mmHg; bimatoprost, 8.7&plusmn;0.3 mmHg; travoprost, 8.0&plusmn;0.3 (P=0.128). Mean reductions from baseline to Week 12 at noon, 4:00 PM, and 8:00 PM also were not statistically different. Furthermore, plots of the mean reduction of the 3 drugs showed very similar distributions, with few poor responders. Fewer latanoprost-treated patients (53.7%) reported ocular adverse events compared with bimatoprost (73.7%), or travoprost (64.5%) (P<0.001, latanoprost versus bimatoprost). In addition, fewer latanoprost patients reported hyperemia (47.1%, 68.6%, and 58.0%, respectively; P=0.001, latanoprost versus bimatoprost), and severity of hyperemia scores were lower in latanoprost patients at Week 12 (P=0.001, latanoprost versus bimatoprost). Conclusions: Equivalence in the ability to reduce IOP in OAG and OH patients was demonstrated among latanoprost, bimatoprost, and travoprost.

Methods: Non-invasive spectrophotometric retinal oximetry was used to measure oxygen saturation in retinal vessels. Twenty patients with open-angle glaucoma (11) and ocular hypertension (9) were recruited. The patients were randomised into receiving timolol monotherapy or dorzolamide-timolol combination for an 8-month test period, followed by a second test period, before which the patients switched treatments. Oximetry measurements were performed at 2-month intervals during each period. Of the 20 patients, 13 followed the study protocol into the second test period, and 10 managed all study visits. Results: The oxygen saturation in retinal vessels was stable within the test periods. The mean arteriolar saturation was 96 (2)% (mean (SD)) during timolol monotherapy and 97 (2)% during dorzolamide-timolol combination therapy (p=0.17, all patients pooled, n=13). Corresponding values in venules were 66 (5)% during timolol monotherapy and 65 (6)% during dorzolamide-timolol therapy (p=0.13). Patients who started on dorzolamide-timolol combination showed a significant reduction in arteriolar (98 (2)% to 95 (2)%, p<0.01) and venular saturation (69 (5)% to 66 (6)%, p<0.05) when changing to timolol monotherapy. Conclusion: Adding dorzolamide to timolol monotherapy has a minimal effect, but going from dorzolamide-timolol combination to timolol alone lowered arteriolar and venular oxygen saturation. The retinal oxygen saturation measurements show a high degree of stability over an extended period of time. Previous studies have suggested increased retinal and optic nerve blood flow with dorzolamide. Unchanged oxygen saturation and increased blood flow would indicate increased oxygen delivery to the retina."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This 8-week, multicentric, interventional, randomized, open-label, parallel group study was conducted at 4 centers in Brazil and 1 center in Argentina. Patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive bilaterally fixed combination of brimonidine/timolol maleate 0.5% or fixed combination of dorzolamide 2%/timolol 0.5% twice daily at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM. A modified diurnal tension curve (8:00 AM, 10:30 AM, 02:00 PM, and 4:00 PM) followed by the water drinking test (WDT), which estimates IOP peak of diurnal tension curve, were performed in the baseline and week-8 visits. Adverse events data were recorded at each visit. RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were randomized (brimonidine/timolol, n=111; dorzolamide/timolol, n=99). Mean baseline IOP was 23.43+/-3.22mm Hg and 23.43+/-4.06mm Hg in the patients treated with brimonidine/timolol and dorzolamide/timolol, respectively (P=0.993). Mean diurnal IOP reduction after 8 weeks were 7.02+/-3.06mm Hg and 6.91+/-3.67mm Hg, respectively (P=0.811). The adjusted difference between groups (analysis of covariance) at week 8 was not statistically significant (P=0.847). Mean baseline WDT peak was 27.79+/-4.29mm Hg in the brimonidine/timolol group and 27.68+/-5.46mm Hg in the dorzolamide/timolol group. After 8 weeks of treatment, mean WDT peaks were 20.94+/-3.76mm Hg (P<0.001) and 20.98+/-4.19 (P<0.001), respectively. The adjusted difference between groups (analysis of covariance) was not statistically significant (P=0.469). No statistical difference in terms of adverse events was found between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both fixed combinations were capable of significantly reducing the mean diurnal IOP, mean diurnal peak, and mean WDT peak after 8 weeks of treatment. Also, both fixed combinations are well tolerated with few side effects. Copyright copyright 2008 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Travoprost versus latanoprost combinations in glaucoma: economic evaluation based on visual field deficit progression	Current Medical Research & Opinion	 	2006	22	9	1737	1743	"OBJECTIVE: Changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) are known to be related to visual field deficit progression, although multiple models of this relationship exist. In addition, visual functioning is known to affect medical costs. The objective of this study was to project visual field deficit progression and subsequent costs based on clinical trial data. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from a randomized, 12-month, double-masked study, we compared the use of a fixed combination of travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% (T/T) versus a fixed combination of latanoprost 0.005%/timolol 0.5% (L/T) on visual field deficit progression and associated costs. We applied published algorithms linking IOP to visual field changes to calculate the likelihood of visual field deterioration by treatment group. Differences in medical care costs were estimated using guideline-recommended practice patterns, Medicare hospital costs, and published estimates of differences in hospitalization by visual functioning. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Increase in visual field deficit progression rates, increase in annual hospital days per subject, and increase in annual hospital, outpatient, and total costs per subject. RESULTS: Predicted visual field deficit progression for T/T patients was less than that for L/T patients (not statistically significant). Projected annual medical care costs were 43 dollars lower for T/T vs. L/T patients. CONCLUSIONS: By applying published algorithms linking IOP to visual field changes, this study projected long-term visual field deficit and associated costs. Use of a fixed travoprost/timolol solution may lead to less long-term visual field deficit progression and lower annual medical care costs than a fixed latanoprost/timolol solution. DISCUSSION: The use of clinical trial data may limit the applicability of these findings. However, this analysis of direct medical costs only is likely a conservative estimate of the costs associated with visual field deficits."

However, a search of MEDLINE indicates that there have been few head-to-head comparisons of the 2 monotherapies in a clinical setting. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the clinical efficacy and tolerability of brimonidine 0.2% twice daily with those of latanoprost 0.005% once daily as monotherapy in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. METHODS: In this 3-month, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group, 4-visit study, treatment-naive and previously treated patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and bilateral intraocular pressure (IOP) after washout of between 22 and 34 mm Hg were randomized to receive either brimonidine or latanoprost. Patients who had received previous treatment with either study drug were excluded from the study. The primary outcome measure was response rate, defined as the percentage of patients achieving > or = 20% reduction in IOP from baseline to month 3. Secondary outcome measures were mean IOP reduction from baseline to month 3 and clinical success, defined as the investigator's recommendation that the patient continue using the assigned study medication. RESULTS: A total of 127 patients (55 treatment naive) were enrolled, 66 in the brimonidine group and 61 in the latanoprost group. After 3 months of treatment, 80% of patients in the brimonidine group and 74% of patients in the latanoprost group had achieved > or = 20% reduction in IOP from baseline. The mean reduction in IOP from baseline at month 3 was 6.8 mm Hg with brimonidine and 6.5 mm Hg with latanoprost (27.8% vs 27.0%, respectively). Among treatment-naive patients, a significantly higher percentage of brimonidine-treated patients achieved > or = 20% decrease in IOP compared with latanoprost-treated patients (88% vs 59%, respectively; P = 0.01). In previously treated patients, a higher percentage of the latanoprost group achieved > or = 20% reduction in IOP compared with the brimonidine group (88% vs 74%, respectively); however, the difference was not statistically significant. Significantly more patients in the brimonidine group achieved clinical success at month 3 compared with patients in the latanoprost group (91% vs 74%; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: At peak effect, brimonidine twice daily was as effective as latanoprost once daily in lowering IOP. In treatment-naive patients, latanoprost was associated with a significantly higher rate of nonresponse after 3 months of treatment compared with brimonidine. This suggests that brimonidine may be the more reliable choice for first-line therapy of newly diagnosed open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In previously treated patients, however, latanoprost provided greater mean IOP reduction than did brimonidine. Significantly more patients achieved clinical success with brimonidine monotherapy than with latanoprost monotherapy.

Italian latanoprost study group"	Journal of glaucoma	J.Glaucoma	1999	8	1	24	30	"PURPOSE: To compare intraocular pressure (IOP) after adding either latanoprost or pilocarpine to timolol treatment or switching to latanoprost monotherapy in glaucomatous eyes in which IOP was inadequately controlled with timolol. METHODS: This 6-month randomized study comprised 148 patients with primary open-angle or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, which was inadequately controlled with topical beta-adrenergic antagonists. After a 2- to 4-week run-in period with timolol 0.5% twice daily, patients were assigned in randomized fashion to three study groups: one group received add-on therapy of latanoprost 0.005% once daily, the second group received add-on therapy of pilocarpine 2% three times daily, and the third group switched to latanoprost 0.005% once daily. Mean diurnal IOP was measured at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. RESULTS: At 6 months, 128 patients had completed the study. Diurnal IOP was significantly reduced from baseline in all groups. Adding latanoprost to timolol treatment reduced diurnal IOP by 6.1+/-0.3 mmHg (-28%), adding pilocarpine to timolol treatment reduced diurnal IOP by 4.2+/-0.3 mmHg (-19%), and switching from timolol to latanoprost monotherapy reduced diurnal IOP by 5.5+/-0.3 mmHg (-25%). CONCLUSION: A significantly greater reduction in diurnal IOP was achieved after addition of latanoprost than after addition of pilocarpine in patients in whom IOP was not adequately controlled with timolol alone. Further, the results of this study indicate that a switch to latanoprost monotherapy can be attempted before combination treatment is initiated.

Pooled 6-month results from two ongoing, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, clinical trials were analyzed. Patients were randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to treatment with bimatoprost 0.03% once a day ([QD] n = 474), bimatoprost 0.03% twice a day ([BID] n = 483), or timolol 0.5% BID (n = 241). Scheduled visits were at prestudy, baseline, week 2, week 6, month 3, and month 6. The primary outcome measure was in diurnal intraocular pressure ([IOP] 8 AM, 10 AM, 4 PM, 8 PM). Bimatoprost QD provided significantly greater mean IOP reductions from baseline than timolol at every time of the day and at each study visit (p </=.05). BID dosing of bimatoprost also provided significantly greater mean IOP reductions than timolol at most timepoints, but was not as effective as QD dosing. The IOP lowering provided by bimatoprost QD was sustained for 6 months. At month 6, the mean IOP reduction from baseline at 10 AM was 8.1 mm Hg (33%) with bimatoprost QD, 6.3 mm Hg (26%) with bimatoprost BID, and 5.6 mm Hg (23%) with timolol. Low target pressures were achieved by a significantly higher percentage of patients in the bimatoprost QD group than in the timolol group. At 10 AM (peak timolol effect) at month 6, IOP </= 17 mm Hg was achieved by 63.9% of bimatoprost QD patients, compared with 37.3% of timolol patients (p <.001). Bimatoprost was safe and well-tolerated, with few discontinuations due to adverse events. The most frequent side effect was trace-to-mild conjunctival hyperemia. Changes in iris pigmentation were reported in 1.1% of bimatoprost patients. There were no other significant findings in slit lamp examinations, ophthalmoscopy, visual acuity, or visual fields, and systemic safety parameters were also unaffected. Together these results indicate that bimatoprost QD is statistically and clinically superior to timolol in lowering IOP, and is safe and well-tolerated in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension."

The dorzolamide/timolol combination versus timolol plus pilocarpine: Patient preference and impact on daily life	Journal of glaucoma	J.Glaucoma	1999	8	5	315	324	"Purpose: To compare the 2.0% dorzolamide/0.5% timolol fixed combination (COSOPT; Merck & Co., Whitehouse Station, NJ) to 0.5% timolol plus 2.0% pilocarpine given concomitantly, and to determine patient preference, tolerability, and impact on daily life in patients with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Methods: Two multi-center, randomized, cross-over, observer masked studies were conducted, one in the United States (97 patients) and one in Europe (93 patients). The Comparison of Ophthalmic Medications for Tolerability questionnaire was used to assess patient preference and perception of side effects and activity limitations resulting from study medications. Intraocular pressure was measured before and 2 hours after the morning dose of study medication (hour 0 and hour 2). Results: In both studies, among patients with a preference, the combination was preferred to timolol plus pilocarpine by a ratio of 4 to 1. The most commonly cited reason for this preference was side effects. Patients in both studies also reported that the combination interfered significantly less with daily life in terms of side effects and activity limitations. They also reported missing significantly fewer doses of study medication while taking the combination and being significantly more satisfied with it. The efficacy of these two treatments was not significantly different, based on IOP measurements at hour 0 and 2 hours after administration. Patients reported significantly more adverse events while receiving timolol plus pilocarpine in both studies, and in the U.S. study, significantly more patients discontinued therapy while receiving timolol plus pilocarpine than while receiving the combination. Conclusion: Compared with timolol plus pilocarpine, patients preferred the combination of 2% dorzolamide/0.5% timolol, and reported less interference in daily activities, better tolerability, and better compliance with therapy."

Methods: Post hoc analysis of a multicenter, double-masked, parallel study comparing the 24-h efficacy of the dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination (N = 117) versus timolol alone (N = 115) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Visual field scoring was performed independently by three glaucoma specialists. Two scoring systems were used: the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) scoring system and a classical visual field scoring system. Patients were divided into three groups based on their visual field scores. The changes from baseline daytime and nighttime mean IOP, and 24-h IOP fluctuation after 8 weeks of treatment by baseline glaucoma severity, were compared across treatments using a simple linear regression analysis. Results: Most ([similar to]73%) patients had no visual field damage at baseline. With either dorzolamide/timolol or timolol alone, there was no significant difference in IOP response from baseline over 24 h based on the level of visual field damage, as measured by either the AGIS or the classic visual field scoring systems. The Pearson's rho correlations between the baseline AGIS score and the change in daytime IOP, nighttime IOP, and 24-h IOP range were 0.0024 (P = 0.97), -0.086 (P = 0.21), and 0.076 (P = 0.26), respectively. Correlations by classic score were 0.024 (P = 0.72), -0.074 (P = 0.28), and 0.061 (P = 0.37), respectively.

Inter-Current Factors Associated with the Development of Open Angle Glaucoma in he European Glaucoma Prevention Study	American Glaucoma Society	 	2007	 	 	38	 	"Introduction: To evaluate the inter-current factors for the development of open angle glaucoma (OAG) in ocular hypertensive patients who were enrolled in the European Glaucoma Prevention Study (EGPS). Methods: The EGPS is a double masked RCT. 1077 patients were enrolled by 18 European centers. The patients fulfilled a series of inclusion criteria, including intraocular pressures (IOP) of 22-29 mmHg; two normal and reliable visual fields and normal optic discs. Patients were assigned to treatment with dorzolamide or placebo. Efficacy end points were visual field and/or optic disc changes. Clinical data, including information about the use of any topical or systemic drugs, were collected every 6 months during follow-up. Proportional hazards models were used to identify factors that occurred during follow up (intercurrent factors), that were associated with the development of OAG. Results: In multivariate analyses, adjusting for treatment arms and baseline predictive factors, the following inter-current factors were associated with the development of OAG: mean follow-up IOP reduction (hazard ratio (HR) 0.88, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.80-0.98), mean follow-up IOP (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.23), area under the curve of IOP (mmHg per year) (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.06-1.11), disc hemorrhages (HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.32-2.67), and the use of systemic diuretics (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.40-4.25). All baseline predictive factors previously identified(1) except for age (central corneal thickness, vertical cup/disc ratio, vertical cup/disc ratio asymmetry and pattern standard deviation) remained statistically significant. Discussion: During follow-up, IOP, the occurrence of optic disc hemorrhages and the use of systemic diuretics are associated with the onset of OAG in patients enrolled in the EGPS. Conclusion: These results suggest the need for future investigations to better elucidate the role of systemic diuretics in the development of OAG, since IOP and disc hemorrhages have already been shown to be important inter-current factors in OHTS(2) and EMGT(3)."

Design: Post hoc analysis of three 6-month, multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-masked registration trials of latanoprost (n = 313) vs timolol (n = 318). Methods: Analyses included patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension who instilled latanoprost once daily in the evening and vehicle in the morning and those instilling timolol twice daily. Pretreatment intervisit IOP range: highest IOP minus lowest IOP of 4 measurements obtained at screening and baseline. Posttreatment intervisit IOP range: highest IOP minus lowest IOP of 4 measurements obtained at weeks 18 and 26. Ranges were dichotomized to high (> 6 mm Hg) and low ([less-than or equal to] 6 mm Hg). Results: Both treatments resulted in significant reductions in mean intervisit IOP range during 26 weeks. Pretreatment, comparable proportions of patients treated with latanoprost and timolol had high intervisit IOP ranges (22% [70/313] and 23% [72/318], respectively; P = .934). After treatment, 6% (19/313) and 11% (35/318) of patients in the latanoprost and timolol groups, respectively, had high intervisit IOP ranges (P = .026). Significant risk factors for high posttreatment intervisit range (multivariate logistic regression) were high pretreatment intervisit IOP range, treatment with timolol, Black race, longer time since diagnosis, and higher mean pretreatment IOP. Conclusions: Compared with timolol, treatment with latanoprost results in significantly fewer patients with a high IOP fluctuation. The impact of reducing high IOP fluctuation on progressive glaucomatous damage deserves further investigation in prospective studies. copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Methods: A randomized, double-masked, multicenter study included patients with ocular hypertension, open-angle, pigmentary, or exfoliation glaucoma. Baseline (after washout) intraocular pressure (IOP) levels were between 23 mmHg and 33 mmHg. Patients received either fixed combination (FC) of latanoprost and timolol once-daily in the evening and placebo in the morning and evening or unfixed combination (uFC) latanoprost once-daily in the evening and timolol morning and evening. Study visits were at weeks 2, 6, and 12. The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change from baseline to week 12 in diurnal IOP (mean IOPs of 8 am, 12 noon, 4 pm). FC was considered non-inferior to uFC if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference was <1.5 mmHg (ANCOVA). Adverse events (AEs) were recorded at each visit. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses included 502 patients (FC, n=255; uFC, n=247). In the FC and uFC groups, mean baseline diurnal IOPs were 25.4 mmHg and 25.2 mmHg, respectively. Mean reductions in diurnal IOPs from baseline to week 12 were 8.7 mmHg and 9.0 mmHg, respectively; the between-treatment difference was 0.3 mmHg (95% CI, -0.1 to 0.7 mmHg [P=0.15]), indicating the FC was non-inferior to the uFC. For those receiving FC and uFC at 12 weeks, 93% and 92%, respectively, had a =20% reduction in mean diurnal IOP (P=0.58), while 76% and 74%, respectively, had mean diurnal IOP level =18 mmHg (P=0.52). Both treatments were well tolerated and safe; <3% of patients in either group withdrew from the study due to an AE. The FC group had fewer treatment-emergent AEs, ocular AEs, or eye irritations. Conclusions: The FC of latanoprost and timolol applied in the evening is non-inferior to the uFC of once nightly latanoprost and twice daily timolol. The FC provides a once-daily alternative to the three instillations needed with the individual components which may interfere with patient compliance."

METHODS: This was a multicenter, crossover, double-masked comparison. After a 28-day treatment-free period, patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized for 6 weeks to brimonidine or latanoprost and then crossed over to the opposite treatment. At baseline and after each treatment period, patients underwent intraocular pressure measurements every 2 hours from 08:00 to 20:00. RESULTS: In 33 patients the mean baseline trough (08:00) was 23.2 +/- 2.1 mm Hg and the diurnal curve pressure was 19.8 +/- 2.7 mm Hg. The trough and diurnal intraocular pressures for brimonidine were 19.6 +/- 3.4 mm Hg and 17.6 +/- 2.2 mm Hg, respectively. Brimonidine statistically reduced the pressure from baseline at each time point except hours 10 and 12 (P =.14 and P =.21, respectively). For latanoprost, the trough and diurnal pressures were 16.2 +/- 2.9 mm Hg and 15.4 +/- 2.5 mm Hg, respectively, and the pressure was statistically reduced at each time point (P <.001) and for the diurnal curve (P <.001). When compared directly, the intraocular pressure level for latanoprost was lower than brimonidine for the diurnal pressure and at each time point (P <.05). One patient was discontinued early from latanoprost treatment because of eyelid swelling; also, latanoprost caused more hyperemia than brimonidine (P =.04). CONCLUSION: This study suggests latanoprost dosed daily in the evening statistically reduces intraocular pressure more during daytime and evening hours than brimonidine dosed twice daily.

A comparison between latanoprost and timolol in treatment of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension	[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology	 	2000	36	4	285	288	"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the therapeutic value of latanoprost on glaucoma. METHODS: In an open-label fashion, multicenter, randomized control clinical trial, the efficacy and adverse drug reactions of topical application of 0.005% latanoprost once daily were compared with that of 0.5% timolol twice daily for 12 weeks in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. RESULTS: The study included 128 patients (63 patients in latanoprost group and 65 patients in timolol group) and 117 patients remained at the end of the study (60 cases in latanoprost group and 57 cases in timolol group). Comparing 12 weeks with baseline diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP), the IOP reduction (mean +/- standard deviation) in latanoprost group was (7.5 +/- 0.3) mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) (32%, t = 22.73, P < 0.0001) greater than the reduction in timolol group (6.1 +/- 0.3) mm Hg (26%, t = 17.94, P < 0.0001), the difference between the two groups being significant (F = 9.54, P = 0.0026). Two patients treated with timolol and none treated with latanoprost were withdrawn from the study because of inadequate IOP control; 3 patients with latanoprost had foreign body sensation. In latanoprost group, there was one patient whose eyelashes became darker and longer at the last visit (the 12th week). No ocular and systemic adverse events related to the two drugs were found. CONCLUSION: It is demonstrated that 0.005% latanoprost topically applied once daily is well tolerated and more effective in reducing IOP than 0.5% timolol topically applied twice daily. Thus, latanoprost has the potential to be a new first-line antiglaucoma drug."

"Objective: To compare long-term intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy of 0.25% and 0.5% apraclonidine hydrochloride with 0.5% timolol maleate. Design: Multicenter, randomized, double-masked trial. Adult patients of either sex diagnosed as having open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were enrolled following appropriate washout from all ocular hypotensive medications. Morning IOPs of 22 to 35 mm Hg were required for entry. Patients received 0.25% or 0.5% apraclonidine 3 times a day or 0.5% timolol twice a day for 90 days. Intraocular pressure was measured at 8 AM (before morning dosing) and at 4 PM (8 hours after dosing) on days 1, 30, and 90, and only at 8 AM on day 14. Results: All 3 medications significantly reduced IOP from baseline at all observation times (P<.001): 0.5% apraclonidine reduced IOP more than 0.25% apraclonidine; no significant difference was observed between 0.5% apraclonidine and 0.5% timolol 8 hours after dosing on days 1, 30, and 90; and a significant difference (P<.05) in favor of 0.5% timolol over 0.25% apraclonidine was observed 8 hours after dosing on day 30. At all morning visits following evening dosing, 0.5% timolol significantly reduced IOP more than both concentrations of apraclonidine. Conclusions: Both 0.25% and 0.5% apraclonidine significantly reduce IOP when used as primary ocular hypotensive medication. Although 0.25% and 0.5% apraclonidine reduce IOP to a similar degree as 0.5% timolol 8 hours after morning dosing, neither concentration is as effective for reducing morning IOP after evening dosing."

DESIGN: Randomized, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. METHODS: Included were patients who were controlled (IOP < 21 mmHg) on the nonfixed combination of latanoprost and timolol for at least 3 months before the baseline visit or patients on monotherapy with either latanoprost or timolol who were eligible for dual therapy not being fully controlled on monotherapy. The latter group of patients underwent a 6-week wash-in phase with the nonfixed combination of latanoprost and timolol before baseline IOP determination and study inclusion. Supine and sitting position IOPs were recorded at 8 pm, midnight, 5 am, 8 am, noon, and 4 pm at baseline, week 6, and week 12 visits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: An analysis of covariance model was used for a noninferiority test of the primary efficacy variable, with mean area under the 24-hour IOP curve after 12 weeks of treatment as response variable and treatment, center, and baseline IOP as factors. A secondary analysis was performed on the within-treatment change from baseline. RESULTS: Mean baseline IOPs were 16.3+/-3.3 mmHg and 15.5+/-2.9.mmHg in the bimatoprost and LTFC groups, respectively. At week 12, mean IOPs were 16.1+/-2.5 mmHg for the bimatoprost group and 16.3+/-3.7 mmHg for the LTFC group, and no significant difference between the 2 treatment groups could be found. As compared with baseline, mean IOP increased by 0.3+/-3.6 mmHg during the day and decreased by 0.8+/-3.8 mmHg during the night in the bimatoprost group, whereas there were increases of 1.43+/-2.6 mmHg and 0.14+/-3.2 mmHg in the LTFC group, respectively.

METHODS: In 2 identical, 12-month, randomized, double-masked multicenter trials, patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma were treated with fixed brimonidine-timolol twice daily (n = 385), 0.2% brimonidine tartrate 3 times daily (n = 382), or 0.5% timolol maleate twice daily (n = 392). MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Mean change from baseline IOP and incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: The mean decrease from baseline IOP during 12-month follow-up was 4.4 to 7.6 mm Hg with fixed brimonidine-timolol, 2.7 to 5.5 mm Hg with brimonidine, and 3.9 to 6.2 mm Hg with timolol. Mean IOP reductions were significantly greater with fixed brimonidine-timolol compared with timolol at all measurements (P< or =.002) and brimonidine at 8 am, 10 am, and 3 pm (P<.001) but not at 5 pm. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events in the fixed-combination group was lower than that in the brimonidine group (P = .006) but higher than that in the timolol group (P<.001). The rate of discontinuation for adverse events was 14.3% with the fixed combination, 30.6% with brimonidine, and 5.1% with timolol. CONCLUSIONS: Twice-daily fixed brimonidine-timolol therapy provides sustained IOP lowering superior to monotherapy with either thrice-daily brimonidine or twice-daily timolol and is better tolerated than brimonidine but less well tolerated than timolol.

Haemodynamics were assessed using fluorescein angiography by means of a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). Visual function and visual field indices were evaluated during all drug treatment phases. METHODS: Fourteen patients with newly diagnosed POAG (age 55 +/- 7 years; 10 male, four female) were recruited for the study. At baseline examination, blood pressure, heart rate, intraocular pressure (IOP), SLO angiograms, and contrast sensitivity (CS) were analysed. Patients then randomly received timolol, dorzolamide or latanoprost treatment for 4 weeks. Patients then returned and all procedures were repeated and assessed. Arteriovenous passage times (AVPs), peripapillary arterial and venous diameters were assessed from SLO angiograms, using digital image processing. Calculated ocular perfusion pressure was determined for each treatment phase. RESULTS: Intraocular pressure was significantly lowered by each drug compared to baseline (p < 0.0001). Arteriovenous passage times were significantly shortened after dorzolamide application compared to baseline (p = 0.009), whereas neither timolol nor latanoprost treatment resulted in significant AVP changes. Peripapillary arterial and venous diameters, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and ocular perfusion pressures were not significantly altered during any treatment phase. Contrast sensitivity testing at 6 cycles/degree (c.p.d.) revealed a significant rise after dorzolamide compared to timolol (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that dorzolamide treatment significantly shortened AVP times in newly diagnosed open-angle glaucoma patients, whereas timolol and latanoprost had no significant effect. Given that prolonged AVP times have been associated with disease progression in glaucoma; dorzolamide treatment may benefit optic nervehead preservation by increasing ocular perfusion."

This report compares the percentages of treated patients achieving such reductions in intraocular pressure after 6 months of treatment with bimatoprost or latanoprost. In the previously published study (Noecker et al: A six-month randomized clinical trial comparing the intraocular pressure-lowering efficacy of bimatoprost and latanoprost in patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma. Am J Ophthalmol 135:55-63, 2003), patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomly assigned to once-daily treatment with bimatoprost 0.03% (n=133) or latanoprost 0.005% (n=136), after washout of any previous glaucoma medications. The primary outcome measure of that study was mean change from baseline intraocular pressure. The secondary, post hoc analysis presented here compares the diurnal and long-term responder rates observed with bimatoprost and latanoprost patients. Diurnal responders were defined as patients who achieved at least a 15% or 20% reduction from baseline intraocular pressure at each of the three timepoints (8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM) on a given visit. At week 1 and months 1, 3, and 6, in the bimatoprost group, 70.7-81.2% of patients achieved at least a 15% reduction in IOP at each timepoint, and 57.9-68.4% achieved at least a 20% reduction. Significantly fewer patients receiving latanoprost achieved a 15% or a 20% decrease in IOP at each timepoint: 48.5-61.8% of patients achieved at least a 15% decrease and 36.0-47.1% achieved at least a 20% decrease. (P[less-than or equal to].007). The data presented here suggest that patients using bimatoprost are more likely than patients using latanoprost to achieve intraocular pressure reductions of at least 15% or 20% from baseline throughout the day. copyright 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In all groups twice-daily medication was used. Mean diurnal IOP as well as ocular and systemic side effects were evaluated at week 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12. Changes in blood pressure, pulse rate, pupil size and patient symptoms were also recorded. At three months all patients had completed the study. Diurnal IOP was significantly reduced from baseline in all groups and consistent IOP reduction was achieved in all three groups at all follow up periods. Mean IOP reduction was 18.40%, 28.45% and 24.64% in group 1, group 2 and group 3, respectively. Flattening of the diurnal fluctuation in IOP was also seen in all patients. On comparing the IOP reduction achieved amongst the three groups, there was a statistically significant difference between group 1 and group 2 as well as between group I and group 3 while the difference between group 2 and group 3 was statistically insignificant.

DESIGN: Randomized, double-masked, crossover study. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four patients with POAG and 20 with OH. METHODS: Patients were treated with latanoprost, travoprost, and bimatoprost for 1 month. The treatment sequence was randomized, and washout lasted 30 days for each trial drug. Four 24-hour tonometric curves were recorded for each patient: 1 at baseline and 1 after each treatment period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraocular pressure was measured at 3, 6, and 9 am; noon; 3, 6, and 9 pm; and midnight by 2 treatment-masked well-trained evaluators using a handheld electronic tonometer with the patient in supine and sitting positions and a Goldmann applanation tonometer with the patient sitting at the slit lamp. Supine systemic blood pressure was recorded at the same times. A randomized-blocks analysis of variance was used to analyze data. RESULTS: All 3 drugs were highly effective in reducing IOP when compared to baseline. Mean IOP reductions were similar after the 3 prostaglandin analogs, and none of the differences among treatments reached statistical significance. The drugs' effect was significantly greater during the daytime (9 am-9 pm) than during the nighttime (midnight-6 am) with all prostaglandin analogs. In 7 of 44 patients (16%), nocturnal IOP was significantly higher than diurnal IOP, both at baseline and under the 3 prostaglandin analogs. CONCLUSIONS: From a clinical point of view, the overall results seem to indicate that the 3 prostaglandin analogs are powerful agents in controlling round-the-clock IOP in POAG and OH patients."

METHODS: Thirty patients with POAG were randomized in an open-label, cross-over study. Intraocular pressure reduction was achieved by 4 weeks medical therapy with D/T twice daily or latanoprost 0.005% dosed once in the evening. During a 4-week run-in and a 4-week wash-out period between study arms, patients ceased use of all other glaucoma medications and used timolol maleate 0.5% twice daily. Primary efficacy variables were IOP and POBF. RESULTS: There was no difference in baseline IOP and POBF parameters between the two study arms. Both D/T and latanoprost statistically significantly reduced IOP by 4.6 mmHg (p < 0.0001) and 3.75 mmHg (p < 0.0001) and increased POBF by 2.048 microl/second (p = 0.0030) and 2.147 microl/second (p = 0.0009), respectively.

"Purpose: Latanoprost, a new prostaglandin analogue, was compared with timolol for ocular hypotensive efficacy and side effects. Methods: In a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel group study, 268 patients with ocular hypertension or early primary open-angle glaucoma received either 0.005% latanoprost once daily or 0.5% timolol twice daily for 6 months. All except ten patients from each group successfully completed the study. Results: Intraocular pressure (IOP) was significantly (P < 0.001) reduced and maintained by both medications without evidence of a long-term drift over 6 months. Comparing 6-month with baseline diurnal IOP values, the IOP reduction (mean +/- standard deviation) achieved with latanoprost (-6.7 +/- 3.4 mmHg) was significantly (P < 0.001) greater than that produced with timolol (-4.9 +/- 2.9 mmHg). Four patients treated with timolol and none treated with latanoprost were withdrawn from the study because of inadequate IOP control. Pulse rate was significantly reduced with timolol, but not with latanoprost. Slightly more conjunctival hyperemia appeared in latanoprost- treated compared with timolol-treated eyes. Fewer subjective side effects occurred in latanoprost-treated eyes. Both eyes of a patient with a characteristic, concentric iris heterochromia (darker centrally) at baseline showed a definite, photographically documented increase in pigmentation during latanoprost treatment, making the irides uniformly darker. Three additional patients treated with latanoprost were suspects for this color change. Otherwise, no significant difference between treatment groups occurred in visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, blood pressure, and laboratory values. Conclusion: Latanoprost has the potential for becoming a new first-line treatment for glaucoma."

Use of the fixed-ratio timolol and pilocarpine combinations resulted in a smaller area under the curve constructed from IOP values and fewer undesirable peaks in IOP than timolol monotherapy."

DESIGN: A prospective, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-design clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifteen patients with IOP inadequately controlled on topical beta-blocker monotherapy. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive brimonidine, 0.2%, twice a day or latanoprost, 0.005%, every day as adjunctive therapy for 3 months. After 1 month of adjunctive treatment, patients who failed to meet a target 15% reduction in IOP at peak drug effect were crossed over to the other study medication. The target sample size of 51/group gave a power of 0.80 to detect a difference of 1 mmHg in mean IOP lowering between groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome variables were reduction in IOP from baseline at peak drug effect, response rate, and quality of life as measured using the Glaucoma Disability Index. RESULTS: Mean beta-blocker-treated baseline IOP was comparable between treatment groups (approximately 21.3 mm Hg). After 1 month of adjunctive therapy, brimonidine and latanoprost provided comparable IOP lowering (4.88 mmHg [22.8%] with brimonidine and 5.01 mmHg [23.5%] with latanoprost, P = 0.798). Response rates were similar in both groups, with 44 of 54 brimonidine patients and 43 of 53 latanoprost patients achieving the minimum target 15% IOP reduction at peak drug effect at month 1 (P = 0.963). Among patients who were successful at month 1 and continued on the initial study medication, mean IOP reductions were 4.55 mmHg with brimonidine and 5.49 mmHg with latanoprost (P = 0.149) at month 3. There was no significant difference in the ability of brimonidine and latanoprost to maintain at least a 15% additional reduction in IOP for 3 months (28 of 38 patients on brimonidine vs. 30 of 36 patients on latanoprost achieved > or =15% IOP reduction at month 3; P = 0.314). Patients in the latanoprost group were more likely to report negative quality-of-life variables than patients in the brimonidine group. Significantly more latanoprost patients reported watery or teary eyes (34 of 53, 64.2% vs. 23 of 54, 42.6% with brimonidine; P = 0.025) and hands and feet that became cold easily (24 of 53, 45.3% vs. 12 of 54, 22.2% with brimonidine; P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: As adjunct therapy with beta-blockers, brimonidine twice daily and latanoprost every day were comparable in lowering IOP at peak effect, but brimonidine was better tolerated, with fewer reports of adverse quality-of-life effects.

Comparison of domatic brimonidine tartrate eye drops with Alphagan to treat primary open -angle glaucoma or ocular hypertention	International Journal of Ophthalmology	 	2006	6	5	1066	1068	"* Aim: To evaluate the ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety of domatic brimonidine tartrate 2g/L compared with Alphagan to treat primary open- angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension. * Methods: Two hundred and forty patients with POAG or ocular hypertension were randomly divided into two groups: trial group (domatic brimonidine tartrate eye drops 2g/L) and control group (Alphagan). One drop was instilled to patients twice daily (at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM). Intraocular pressure (IOP) at 2 hours after instilling the first dose, and 1, 2 and 4 weeks after sustained instilling were compared with the baseline. On the other hand, systematic and local adverse effects were also observed. * Results: In trial group, the mean IOP was 23.74 +/- 4.77mmHg at baseline, 19.38 +/- 4.51mmHg (decreased 17.58%) at 2 hours after instilling the first dose, 18.34 +/- 4.57mmHg (decreased 22.19%) at 1 week after sustained instilling, 18.42+/- 4.32mmHg (decreased 21.73%) at 2 weeks after sustained instilling, 18.56 +/- 4.46mmHg (decreased 21.06%) at 4 weeks after sustained instilling, respectively. In control group, the mean IOP was 24.54+/- 5.66mmHg, 20.60+/- 5.70mmHg (decreased 15.46%), 19.79 +/- 6.50mmHg (decreased 18.82%) 19.46+/- 5.05mmHg (decreased 19.59%), 19.73+/- 5.68mmHg (decreased 18.73%), respectively. The difference between two groups in ocular hypotensive efficacy was not significant. No systematic and local adverse effects were observed in these two groups. * Conclusion: Instilling domatic brimonidine tartrate eye drops twice daily shows ocular hypotensive efficacy similar to Alphagan, and a similarly rate of systematic and local adverse effects.

At month 6, levels were 16.9 (SD 2.8) mm Hg in FC latanoprost/timolol patients and 18.2 (SD 3.1) mm Hg in UFC brimonidine/timolol patients (p<0,001). No adverse events were reported by 76.4% and 75.5% of patients receiving FC latanoprost/timolol versus UFC brimonidine/ timolol, respectively. Larger proportions of brimonidine/ timolol treated patients reported study medication related adverse events (18.6% v 7.3%) and discontinued study participation because of this (10.8% v 1.8%).

Comparison of carteolol plasmatic levels after repeated instillations of long-acting and regular formulations of carteolol 2% in glaucoma patients	Graefes Archive for Clinical & Experimental Ophthalmology	 	2005	243	12	1221	1227	"BACKGROUND: A new long-acting (LA) formulation of carteolol 2% instilled once daily has been shown to provide a therapeutic effect similar to that of the regular formulation of carteolol 2% instilled twice daily. This study was designed to test whether the new formulation reduces the systemic delivery of carteolol. METHODS: In this double-masked, randomised, intra-subject comparative study, 23 patients with bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma or bilateral ocular hypertension received sequentially, according to the randomised order of administration, each of the 2 following treatments: carteolol 2% LA once daily for 2 months and carteolol 2% regular twice daily for 2 months. Treatments were instilled in both eyes throughout the study period. At the end of each period of treatment, blood samples were taken immediately before the last morning instillation (residual time), then 30 min, 1 h, 2 h and 4 h after this instillation in order to measure the carteolol plasma concentrations. RESULTS: The mean values of maximal plasma concentration (C(max)), residual level and area under the curve obtained following carteolol 2% LA treatment were significantly lower than the values obtained after carteolol 2% regular treatment (mean+/-SD): C(max) (ng/ml): 1.72+/-0.85 versus 3.64+/-3.65; residual level (ng/ml): 0.70+/-0.58 versus 1.80+/-0.84; area under the curve (ng/mlxh): 5.50+/-2.66 versus 10.27+/-5.46. Regarding safety, two drug-related, non-serious adverse events were reported in the LA group: one case of moderate, superficial, punctate keratitis and one case of ""bitter taste in the throat."" Both treatments appeared to be well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The data from this study showed that the systemic delivery of carteolol is lower for the once-daily LA formulation than for the regular twice-daily formulation. Consequently, long-acting carteolol eye-drops should reduce the risk of beta-blocking systemic side effects.

Methods: This was a randomized, observer-masked, multicenter, parallel-group study of patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma. Following an open-label 3-week timolol maleate b.i.d. run-in period, 293 patients with a peak IOP of =22 mmHg were randomized to receive either dorzolamide hydrochloride/timolol maleate combination solution, 1 drop b.i.d., or concomitant therapy with brimonidine tartate and timolol maleate, 1 drop of each solution b.i.d., for 3 months. Peak IOP was measured 2 hours after study drug administration at randomization and month 3. Treatment groups were compared in terms of change in peak IOP from randomization to month 3. Results: The dorzolamide hydrochloride/timolol maleate combination group had an adjusted mean (SE) change in peak IOP (based on an Analysis of Covariance model) of -5.04 (0.30) mmHg compared to -5.41 (0.30) mmHg in the brimonidine tartate and timolol maleate group. The adjusted mean (SE) treatment difference in peak IOP was 0.36 (0.40) mmHg with a 95% confidence interval of -0.42 to 1.14 mmHg.

Methods: All procedures were approved by an IRB, and informed consent was obtained. Fifteen patients with POAG (58.4 &plusmn; 7.2 years, 7 male, 8 female) were recruited for this double blind randomized cross-over study. All patients received a 4 week timolol (bid) run in before baseline measurements and drug therapies. Treatment regimes consisted of 8 weeks of 0.2% brimonidine (tid) or continuation of 0.5% timolol (bid) and placebo (qd) for 8 weeks. Color Doppler imaging (CDI) using a Siemens Quantum 2000 (Siemens Quantum, Inc., Issaquah WA) with a 7.5 MHz linear probe was performed in a randomly chosen eye. Retrobulbar flow was assessed by measuring the peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), and resistive index (RI) of the short posterior temporal and nasal ciliary arteries (PCA), ophthalmic artery (OA), and central retinal artery (CRA). Contrast sensitivity (CS) was measured using a rear-illuminated CS chart (CSV 1000). Linear regression analysis was used to determine the correlation between retrobulbar blood flow and contrast sensitivity. Results: As OA PSV and EDV blood flow measures improved, CS improved (p=0.008, r2=0.48 and r2 =0.49, p=0.008, respectively). Accordingly, a negative correlation was found between increased OA resistance measured by RI and decreased contrast sensitivity (r2=0.423, p=0.016). Conclusions: A significant correlation between ophthalmic artery hemodynamics and CS was demonstrated in POAG patients. This suggests a possible association of retrobulbar hemodynamics with visual function."

Inhibition of the epinephrine-induced reduction of intraocular pressure by systemic indomethacin in humans	American Journal of Ophthalmology	Am.J.Ophthalmol.	1985	100	1	169	175	"In a prospective, randomized, double-masked study, 2% epinephrine applied topically twice each day for two weeks to the eyes of patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension caused an 8.1 +/- 1.4-mm Hg (mean +/- S.E.M.) reduction of intraocular pressure in placebo-treated patients, but only a 1.9 +/- 0.6-mm Hg decrease in patients treated with 25 mg of orally administered indomethacin four times each day (P less than .0005). Systemic treatment with indomethacin for one week did not significantly increase intraocular pressure by itself (baseline, 19.7 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, vs 20.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg after indomethacin treatment). When indomethacin treatment was discontinued in those patients receiving topical epinephrine, there was a further significant (P less than .05) reduction in intraocular pressure compared with the placebo-treated group. Since the ocular hypotensive effect of topically applied epinephrine is inhibited by indomethacin, a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, these results suggest that this reduction of intraocular pressure is at least partially mediated by the endogenous production of prostaglandins, or other cyclo-oxygenase products, and that the intraocular pressure of glaucoma patients undergoing epinephrine therapy may increase when systemic cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors such as indomethacin or aspirin are taken."

DESIGN: Longitudinal randomized clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-eight eyes of 152 ocular hypertensive participants ages 40 to 80 years. METHODS: Cox hazard models were applied to 3232 eyes, which included 81 eyes that reached a study end point by developing a glaucomatous VF (VF end point) and 128 eyes that reached a study end point by developing an optic disc change (optic disc end point). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary open-angle glaucoma end point as determined by changes in the VF or optic disc. RESULTS: Forty-one eyes reached an end point by both VF and optic disc criteria; 40 eyes reached only a VF end point, and 87 reached only an optic disc end point. Times to reach isolated disc or field end points were similar. Visual field end points were more likely (P<0.0001) in eyes that showed the following ONH features: an ONH hemorrhage, thinning of the optic disc rim, or enlargement of the horizontal cup-to-disc (C/D) ratio. Optic disc end points were more likely (P<0.0001) in eyes that showed the following VF features: some evidence of a nasal step or a partial arcuate VF defect, or an increase in the pattern standard deviation (PSD). CONCLUSIONS: Both the VF and the optic disc must be monitored with equal diligence, because either may show the first evidence of glaucomatous damage. Changes in the ONH based on stereophotographic observation (rim thinning, hemorrhage, or a slight increase in C/D ratio) and VF changes (evidence of a nasal step/partial arcuate defect or an increase in PSD) suggest that these cases have an increased risk of developing glaucoma. Confirmation of such subtle findings should be sought through repeat testing and correlation with other clinical results."

BACKGROUND: Patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension often require >1 medication to achieve control of intraocular pressure (IOP). Both brimonidine and latanoprost effectively lower IOP, but no previously reported clinical trials have directly compared these agents as adjunctive therapy. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, investigator-masked, multicenter, parallel-design clinical trial. Forty patients (69 study eyes) with uncontrolled IOP of  or =15% reduction in IOP from baseline. RESULTS: There were no significant between-group differences in any demographic variable. Most patients in each group were white, had open-angle glaucoma, and were being treated with a nonselective beta-blocker and dorzolamide. When brimonidine or latanoprost was used as an adjunctive agent with a beta-blocker and dorzolamide or pilocarpine, the rates of clinical success at month 1 were 85% (17/20 patients) with brimonidine versus 65% (13/20 patients) with latanoprost (P = 0.144). Overall mean IOP reduction at month 1 was 4.60+/-0.62 mm Hg (22.8%; P < 0.001) with brimonidine and 3.43+/-0.62 mm Hg (17.2%; P < 0.001) with latanoprost, with no significant differences between groups (P = 0.219). Among the patients with an inadequate IOP-lowering response (<15% reduction from baseline), the mean IOP reduction was 0.36+/-0.66 mm Hg with latanoprost (n = 7) and 0.50+/-2.18 mm Hg with brimonidine (n = 3). Brimonidine and latanoprost had comparable IOP-lowering efficacy in patients receiving concomitant pilocarpine therapy (mean change in IOP of -4.23 mm Hg vs -3.75 mm Hg, P = 0.173). In patients concurrently treated with dorzolamide, brimonidine produced a mean change in IOP of -5.29 mm Hg, compared with a mean change of -3.21 mm Hg in the latanoprost group (P = 0.159). Both brimonidine and latanoprost were well tolerated. Few adverse events leading to discontinuation were observed with either drug regimen (n = 2 with brimonidine; n = 0 with latanoprost). CONCLUSIONS: Both brimonidine 0.2% BID and latanoprost 0.005% QD were well-tolerated and reduced IOP in most patients when used as third-line adjunctive therapy. However, clinical success was achieved by 17 of 20 patients (85%) who received brimonidine, compared with 13 of 20 patients (65%) who received latanoprost (P = 0.144).

In the global improvement rating calculated by the decrease rate of outflow pressure, the rates of cases evaluated as ""moderately improved"" or more were 55.9% in the L group, 63.6% in the M group and 76.5% in the H group, showing the dose-dependent increase in the improvement rate but there was no significant difference among 3 groups. However, when the dose-response relationship in the rates of ""moderately improved"" or more was analyzed by Cochran-Armitage test under Permutation method, the significant dose-response relationship dependent on the concentration was confirmed. Intraocular pressure decreased significantly at both 2nd and 4th week of instillation in 3 groups, but there was no significant difference among 3 groups in the change of intraocular pressure. Adverse reactions were observed in 3 events of 2 cases (4.8%) in the L group, 2 events of 2 cases (5.0%) in the M group and 4 events of 2 cases (4.9%) in the H group, and the incidences were not significantly different among 3 groups.

DESIGN: Double-masked, 2-center, prospective, crossover comparison. PARTICIPANTS: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) subjects. METHODS: Subjects were randomized to brimonidine purite or dorzolamide, each given twice daily, for the first 6-week treatment period after a 6-week latanoprost run-in. Subjects began the opposite treatment for the second 6-week period after a 6-week latanoprost-only treatment between periods. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at 8 am, 12 pm, 4 pm, 8 pm, 12 am, 4 am, and 8 am at each baseline and at the end of each treatment period. This study provided an 80% power that a 1.5-mmHg difference could be excluded between groups if 27 subjects completed the study. A standard deviation (SD) of 2.8 mmHg was assumed.

The 8 am IOP after 6 weeks of therapy was 18.4+/-2.1 mmHg for brimonidine purite and 18.9+/-1.9 mmHg for dorzolamide (P = 0.40). The mean diurnal IOP was 16.9+/-1.5 mmHg for brimonidine purite and 16.8+/-1.5 mmHg for dorzolamide (P = 0.66). Dorzolamide caused a more bitter taste (P = 0.01) than brimonidine purite. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that brimonidine purite and dorzolamide, added to latanoprost, have similar efficacy and safety in POAG or ocular hypertensive subjects.

One-hundred-thirty-two patients requiring an adjunctive therapy to timolol 0.5% for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive brinzolamide or placebo three times daily (t.i.d.) in addition to timolol 0.5% twice daily (b.i.d.) for 3 months. Qualifying intraocular pressure (IOP) on timolol 0.5% b.i.d. was 24-36 mm Hg in at least one eye at 8:00 A.M. and 21-36 mm Hg at 10:00 A.M., with no greater than a 5-mm Hg difference between eyes, during two eligibility visits separated by at least 7 days. Treatments were compared using a repeated-measures analysis of variance. Adjunctive therapy with brinzolamide resulted in clinically and statistically significant reductions in IOP from the timolol baseline at all visits. IOP changes from a diurnal baseline ranged from -3.3 mm Hg to -4.1 mm Hg for brinzolamide (N = 53) compared with -0.9 mm Hg to -2.5 mm Hg for placebo (N = 55). Abnormal taste (7.7%) and transient blurred vision (6.2%) were the most frequently reported adverse events. No clinically significant differences in the incidence or severity of ocular signs, visual acuity, cup/disk ratio, or parameters studied on dilated fundus examination were observed between treatment groups.

Each examination included visual field measurements with an Octopus automated perimeter 201 (Program G1), intraocular pressure measurement, funduscopy, as well as pulse and arterial blood pressure measurements. Both drugs lowered in the intraocular pressure. This reduction was slightly but not statistically significantly higher in the timolol-treated group. However, the visual fields improved more in the betaxolol group.

DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of prospectively collected data from a previously reported multicenter, investigator-masked, randomized clinical trial of bimatoprost and latanoprost. METHODS: Patients were treated bilaterally with bimatoprost (n = 133) or latanoprost (n = 136) for six months. IOP measurements were taken at 8 am, 12 pm, and 4 pm at baseline, week 1, and months 1, 3, and 6. Long-term IOP fluctuation during treatment was determined as the standard deviation (SD) of all 12 follow-up measurements. RESULTS: There was no significant between-group difference in short-term daily IOP fluctuation at baseline. Long-term IOP fluctuation over six months of treatment [mean SD (range SD)] was 1.9 (0.5 to 6.3) mm Hg with latanoprost vs 1.7 (0.5 to 3.9) mm Hg with bimatoprost (P = .050). Latanoprost-treated eyes were more likely than bimatoprost-treated eyes to have long-term IOP fluctuation of > or =3 mm Hg (7.8% vs 2.5% of eyes; P = .009).

METHODS: This was a randomized, crossover, investigator-masked, active-control study of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Patients received either once-daily 0.5% timolol GFS (n=40) or once-daily 0.005% latanoprost (n=35) for 8 weeks (period 1). Patients were then crossed over to the other medication and treated for another 8 weeks (period 2). Intraocular pressure (IOP) was determined every 2 hours from 8:00 to 20:00 at baseline and weeks 8 and 16. Safety was assessed by visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and adverse event reports. RESULTS: During period 1, reduction in mean (SD) diurnal IOP was significantly greater in latanoprost-treated patients (-6.9 [3.0] mm Hg) than in timolol GFS-treated patients (-5.5 [2.4] mm Hg), p=0.034. There was also a significant reduction in IOP from baseline after switching from timolol GFS to latanoprost (p<0.001), not observed when patients were switched from latanoprost to timolol GFS. After results from each drug's treatment periods were combined between treatment arms, latanoprost reduced IOP more (-6.9 [2.9] mm Hg) than did timolol GFS (-6.2 [2.7] mm Hg), p=0.018. Hyperemia was the most common adverse event in both treatment groups, with 5 incidences in timolol GFS-treated patients, and 10 in latanoprost.

"Purpose: The purpose of the study was to compare the systemic safety and risk-benefit ratio of 0.1% timolol hydrogel and 0.5% aqueous timolol eye drops in the treatment of glaucoma. Methods: An 8-week randomised, double-blind, cross-over, multicentre study. A total of 25 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, exfoliation glaucoma, or ocular hypertension was enrolled. After completing a wash-out period, patients were randomly chosen to receive either 0.1% timolol hydrogel once daily or 0.5% aqueous timolol eye drops twice daily. Intraocular pressure and heart rate during rest and exercise, head-up tilt test results, spirometry readings, and plasma concentrations of timolol were recorded. The risk-benefit ratio was determined by calculating the ratio between several heart rate endpoints and the change in intraocular pressure (IOP). Results: The mean drug-induced change in the peak heart rate during exercise was -13.5 beats/min (SD 7.6) in the 0.5% aqueous timolol group and -5.1 beats/min (SD 6.7) in the 0.1% timolol hydrogel group (P<0.001; 95% CI 4.06-12.18). There was no significant difference in the IOP-reducing efficacy between these compounds. The risk-benefit ratio was significantly improved when 0.1% timolol hydrogel was used, compared with 0.5% aqueous timolol in the exercise test. In the head-up tilt test the risk-benefit ratio was significantly improved at rest (P<0.05), at 1 min (P<0.05) and at 5 min (P<0.001) after patients had received 0.1% timolol hydrogel. There were, however, no differences in spirometry readings. After patients had been treated with 0.1% timolol hydrogel, plasma concentrations of timolol were 1/6 (at peak) and 1/50 (at trough) of those of 0.5% aqueous timolol. Conclusions: Drug-induced changes in the peak heart rate, and head-up tilt test results as well as plasma concentrations of timolol, were significantly more pronounced after treatment with 0.5% aqueous timolol than with 0.1% timolol hydrogel. Because of the statistically similar IOP-reducing efficacy of these formulations the risk-benefit ratio was significantly improved when patients used 0.1% timolol hydrogel instead of 0.5% aqueous timolol. copyright Springer-Verlag 2006.

METHODS: In a double-masked, multicenter, crossover comparison in 40 patients, qualified patients were washed out from their previous medication and randomized to dorzolamide 2% or brimonidine 0.2% for the first 6-week treatment period. Patients then were washed out for 2 weeks and started on the opposite medication for the second 6-week period. RESULTS: Baseline intraocular pressure for all 40 subjects (76 eyes) was 24.1 +/- 2.0 mm Hg. This study found that the 8:00 AM trough intraocular pressure after 6 weeks of therapy for dorzolamide was 20. 7 +/- 3.1 mm Hg and for brimonidine 20.8 +/- 3.2 mm Hg (P =.99). The peak intraocular pressure (2 hours after dosing) for dorzolamide was 18.6 +/- 3.4 mm Hg and for brimonidine 17.8 +/- 2.7 mm Hg (P =.10 ). Dorzolamide caused more stinging upon instillation (P <.01) and brimonidine more itching (P =.01). No statistical differences existed between groups for systemic adverse events. Six patients, all on brimonidine, were discontinued from a treatment period early.

METHODS: The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study enrolled 1,636 subjects. Of these, 817 subjects were randomized to receive topical ocular hypotensive medication and 819 subjects were randomized to close observation (i.e., no topical medication). We compared the intraocular pressure of the contralateral eye of subjects at the baseline visit and after an initial one-eyed therapeutic trial of topical beta-blockers. We examined differences between baseline and follow-up intraocular pressure in untreated eyes of subjects randomized to close observation. RESULTS: The mean reduction in intraocular pressure in the beta-blocker-treated eyes was -5.9 +/- 3. 4 mm Hg (-22% +/- 12%; Student t test, P <.0001). In the contralateral eyes, mean intraocular pressure reduction was -1.5 +/- 3.0 mm Hg (-5.8% +/- 12%; P <.0001). Of the contralateral eyes, 35% showed a reduction of 3 mm Hg or more, and 10% showed a reduction of 6 mm Hg or more. The contralateral effect of the relatively selective beta-blocker betaxolol did not differ from that of any of the nonselective beta-blockers. Factors associated with the magnitude of the contralateral effect were the degree of intraocular pressure reduction in the treated eye and baseline intraocular pressure of the contralateral eye. In the close observation group, no significant reduction in intraocular pressure was noted between the baseline and follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS: The contralateral effect is important in clinical practice and in clinical trials when the hypotensive effect of a topical beta-blocker is evaluated by means of a one-eyed therapeutic trial."

"Objective: To compare the circadian intraocular pressure (IOP) reductions induced by latanoprost, brimonidine tartrate, and a fixed combination of timolol maleate and dorzolamide hydrochloride in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). Methods: In this crossover study, 10 patients with POAG and 10 with OHT were treated with latanoprost once a day, brimonidine twice a day, and a fixed combination of timolol and dorzolamide twice a day for 1 month. Four 24-hour tonometric curves were obtained for each patient. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at 3, 6, and 9 AM, and at noon and at 3, 6, and 9 PM, and at midnight, using a handheld electronic tonometer with the patient in supine and sitting positions and a Goldmann applanation tonometer with the patient sitting at the slitlamp. Main Outcome Measure: Reduction of circadian IOP. Results: All the drugs significantly reduced IOP compared with the baseline at all times, except for brimonidine at midnight, 3 AM, and 6 AM. Latanoprost was more effective than brimonidine in lowering IOP at 3 and 6 AM and at 3 PM (P =.03), and the combination of timolol and dorzolamide was more effective than brimonidine at 3 and 9 AM (P = .04) and at 3 and 6 PM (P = .05) and more effective than latanoprost at 9 AM (P = .05). Conclusion: Latanoprost and the fixed combination of timolol and dorzolamide led to similar circadian reductions in IOP, whereas brimonidine was less effective, particularly during the night.

Patients instilled their study medications twice daily for 4 weeks, and were followed at baseline visit, weeks 2 and 4. Demographic data, reduction of IOP, safety and adverse events were obtained and analyzed. RESULTS: Both drugs showed sustained ocular hypotensive efficacy in the study period. At baseline, the mean IOP was 24.48 +/- 2.29 mmHg in the brimonidine group and 23.32 +/- 0.82 mmHg in the timolol group. The IOP readings after treatment were significantly lower than their baseline levels in both groups at all visits (p < 0.001). At peak, the mean decreases from the baseline IOP ranged from 5.22 +/- 0.30 mmHg to 6.96 +/- 0.33 mmHg for brimonidine and from 4.55 +/- 0.49 mmHg to 6.64 +/- 0.53 mmHg for timolol. At trough, the mean decreases from baseline ranged from 3.72 +/- 0.32 mmHg to 4.55 +/- 0.32 mmHg for brimonidine and 3.82 +/- 0.52 mmHg to 4.27 +/- 0.51 mmHg for timolol. No significant between-group differences were seen at peak or trough at all visits. The clinical success rate was 86.2% in the brimonidine group and 81.8% in the timolol group, making no statistically significant difference between them (p = 0.817). 17.2% of patients in brimonidine group and 9.0% patients in timolol group reported mild adverse events. Ocular allergy occurred in 10.3% of patients in brimonidine group. No significant changes in visual acuity, biomicroscopy or ophthalmoscopy were observed in both groups. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained relatively stable in both groups except in week 2 (p = 0.016) when brimonidine had lower systolic blood pressure. However, brimonidine showed no significant difference in week 4 from baseline. The mean heart rate in the brimonidine group was relatively unchanged over the study period. Patients receiving timolol experienced statistically significant mean heart rate decreases from baseline (p = 0.020) in week 4. CONCLUSIONS: Topically applied twice daily for one month, brimonidine tartrate 0.2% has clinical effectiveness equivalent to timolol 0.5% in Taiwanese patients with glaucoma. It has a safe systemic profile with minimum effect on the heart."

METHODS: Patients with either primary or secondary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension participated in a 6-month, randomized, double-masked, multicenter study with 3 parallel treatment groups. The double-masked period was preceded by a 2- to 4-week ""run-in"" treatment with timolol. Subjects could receive fixed combination therapy during a 6-month open-label extension. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The difference between groups in mean diurnal intraocular pressure reduction in study eye(s) from baseline through 6 months of treatment. RESULTS: Overall, 418 patients were enrolled in the study; 332 completed the open-label phase. Diurnal intraocular pressure levels were similar at baseline, but at week 26, they were 19.9 +/- 3.4 mm Hg in the fixed combination therapy group, 20.8 +/- 4.6 mm Hg in latanoprost-treated patients, and 23.4 +/- 5.4 mm Hg in timolol-treated patients (data are given as mean +/- SD). The mean change from baseline was greater among patients receiving fixed combination therapy compared with each monotherapy group (P<.01). Fixed combination therapy effectively lowered intraocular pressure levels for up to 1 year. All treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The combination of 0.005% latanoprost and 0.5% timolol administered once daily is effective and well tolerated for up to 12 months.

In a 12-month extension of two identically designed 1-year, multicenter, randomized, double-masked clinical trials, patients were treated topically with bimatoprost 0.03% QD (n=167), bimatoprost 0.03% BID (n=131), or timolol 0.5% BID (n=81). Main outcome measures were IOP at 8 AM and 10 AM and safety parameters. Bimatoprost QD provided significantly greater mean reduction from baseline IOP than did timolol at both measurements at each study visit (P[less-than or equal to].001). At 10 AM (peak timolol effect) at month 24, the mean reduction from baseline IOP was 7.8 mm Hg with bimatoprost QD and 4.6 mm Hg with timolol (P<.001). Patients treated with bimatoprost QD also sustained significantly lower mean IOP than timolol-treated patients at every follow-up visit throughout the 2-year study period (P[less-than or equal to].006). At 10 AM at month 24, a significantly greater proportion of bimatoprost QD than timolol patients achieved target pressures of [less-than or equal to]13-18 mm Hg (P[less-than or equal to].010). Bimatoprost sustained an excellent safety profile during the second year of treatment. Most adverse events were mild, and there were no reports of increased iris pigmentation, uveitis, or CME. The incidence of hyperemia was significantly higher with bimatoprost QD (13.8%) than with timolol (2.5%) (P=.006). Mean reduction from baseline IOP with bimatoprost BID was not significantly different from that with timolol at month 24 at 10 AM (P=.474).

METHODS: Three multicenter, double-masked, parallel trials were completed in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension of 3 months' treatment duration. Studies 1 and 2 were three-arm comparisons of betaxolol, pilocarpine, and a fixed combination, each used 3 times daily. Study 3 was a two-arm study of the fixed combination with and without a surfactant, used twice daily. In all studies, there was a 1-month runin period with betaxolol 0.25% suspension given twice daily. There were 182 patients in Study 1, 186 patients in Study 2, and 166 patients in Study 3. RESULTS: In all 3 studies, approximately 10% to 15% of patients treated with pilocarpine or the combination therapy were terminated from further participation because of typical pilocarpine side effects (eg, blurred vision, headache). In studies 1 and 2, there was a mean reduction in intraocular pressure from a betaxolol baseline of approximately 3 to 4 mmHg. Patients continuing on betaxolol alone or randomly assigned to pilocarpine alone experienced a mean reduction of 1 to 2 mm Hg. Overall, the combination was approximately 2 mmHg more effective than either betaxolol or pilocarpine alone. In Study 3, the two betaxolol combinations had equivalent efficacy. CONCLUSION: In patients requiring more than one ocular hypotensive agent, the combination of betaxolol and pilocarpine in a single formulation appears to be an effective and relatively safe agent. The use of this combination agent promises the potential for enhanced patient convenience."

Brinzolamide 1.0%, a new topical ocular carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is effective apparently without significant systemic side effects. This study was performed to establish the long-term safety and efficacy of brinzolamide 1.0% two and three times daily for primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. METHODS: An 18-month, multicenter, double-masked, parallel, controlled study was conducted. Patients were randomized to brinzolamide two or three times daily or timolol 0.5% twice daily in a 2:2:1 ratio (n = 150, 153, and 75, respectively). Intraocular pressure was measured at 8:00 AM at eligibility and months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18. Efficacy was based on intraocular pressure reduction from baseline. Safety was also evaluated. RESULTS: All regimens produced clinically relevant and statistically significant (P<.05) intraocular pressure reductions from baseline. Mean changes in intraocular pressure trough measurements ranged from -2.7 to -3.9 mm Hg with brinzolamide twice-daily dosing and -2.8 to -3.8 mm Hg three times daily dosing compared with -4.7 to -5.6 mm Hg with timolol. The intraocular pressure reductions with brinzolamide two and three times daily were clinically and statistically equivalent. One hundred forty-four patients were discontinued from the study after randomization with the most common reasons being the occurrence of an adverse event (46), inadequate intraocular pressure control (23), patient decision unrelated to study medication (11), lost to follow-up (16), and noncompliance (9). Adverse events were nonserious and resolved without sequelae. There were no clinically relevant changes in safety parameters. Brinzolamide produced less ocular discomfort (burning/stinging) than timolol, and total carbonic anhydrase inhibition levels remained below that known to cause systemic side effects. CONCLUSION: Brinzolamide produced significant and equivalent reductions in intraocular pressure when dosed two and three times daily for 18 months. Brinzolamide was safe and well tolerated by patients, with minimal ocular discomfort.

However, these drugs can be absorbed into the systemic circulation through the naso-lacrimal duct to produce various systemic side effects. Aims: The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of topical timolol, levobunolol and betaxolol on the cardiovascular system in Indian patients of chronic simple glaucoma. Settings And Design: This prospective randomized single-blind parallel study was conducted in the Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics in collaboration with the Department of Ophthalmology of a teaching institute. Methods And Material: Forty newly diagnosed patients of chronic simple glaucoma were included in the study. 16 patients (23 eyes), 12 patients (19 eyes) and 12 patients (20 eyes) were randomized to receive 0.5% timolol maleate, 0.5% levobunolol hydrochloride and 0.5% betaxolol hydrochloride respectively, as one drop twice a day instillation for 12 weeks. Blood pressure, pulse rate and intraocular pressure of each patient were recorded at 0, 6 and 12 weeks. Statistics: Effects of the individual drug on various study parameters were analysed using the paired ttest. P values <0.05 were taken as significant. A comparative analysis of the effects of the three drugs on the above parameters was done by using the analysis of variance test. Inter-group comparison was done using the Turkey test. Results: Topical timolol, levobunolol and betaxolol lowered IOP by 13.05 +/- 1.53, 14.05 +/- 1.47 and 7.58 +/- 0.90 mm of Hg respectively, at 6 weeks and by 16.12+/-1.67, 16.28+/-1.85 and 8.53+/-0.98 respectively, at 12 weeks (P<0.001). Both topical timolol and levobunolol produced more reduction in IOP than topical betaxolol, with P-values of 0.004 and 0.002 at 6 and 12 weeks respectively. All the three drugs produced a statistically significant reduction in the pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, indicating the systemic absorption of beta-blockers in a concentration enough to alter the cardiovascular parameters of the patients. On comparative analysis using analysis of variance, a statistically insignificant difference for change in the three parameters was observed among the three groups. Conclusion: The results of our study necessitate an urgent need for ophthalmological physicians to exclude all the possible cardiovascular problems in the patients before prescribing a topical beta-blocker."

METHODS: 22 patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were included in a 4 week open label study. Median age was 68 years (range 50-79). They were allocated to either 2 weeks' treatment with once daily evening administration of latanoprost monotherapy (50 micrograms/ml) or twice daily dipivefrin monotherapy (1 mg/ml), followed by 2 weeks' combination therapy with both drugs. RESULTS: Latanoprost alone reduced IOP from 19.3 (SD 1.4) to 14.8 (0.9) mm Hg (p < 0.01). Addition of dipivefrin caused a further reduction to 12.4 (0.9) mm Hg (p < 0.01 compared with latanoprost alone). In the group where the treatment started with dipivefrin IOP was reduced from 22.3 (1.2) to 18.4 (1.0) mm Hg (p < 0.01) and with the combination to 14.9 (0.9) mm Hg (p < 0.01). No change in aqueous flare was observed with either drug, alone or in combination. A slight increase in conjunctival hyperaemia was observed when the two drugs were combined. CONCLUSIONS: Latanoprost and dipivefrin have an additive effect on IOP and no clinically significant effect on the permeability to proteins of the blood-aqueous barrier. This implies that the two drugs can be a useful combination for the treatment of glaucoma."

All patients who after six years of follow-up showed no localized field defects or disk changes, or whose pressures were not dangerously increased (24 treated and 22 untreated patients), were included in the present study. Overall, the two groups showed an increase in pressure followed by a gentle leveling off and a decrease toward the end of the follow-up period. The pressure-time curves of the two groups were parallel and vertically separated by 4.94 mm Hg. When pressure-time relationships were determined in individual patients, the categorical group differences were not statistically significant. Our results suggest that most glaucoma suspects did not exhibit a random time-course of intraocular pressure and that the effect of treatment was simply to lower the pressure-time curve of the treated group by a fixed level throughout the six-year follow-up period."

Design: Prospective, randomized, investigator-masked trial. Participants: Twenty-six subjects with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma. Methods: Subjects attended 5 study visits: 2 on no IOP-lowering therapy, 1 on monocular therapy with latanoprost, and 2 on bilateral therapy. The monocular trial eye was randomly selected, and study personnel making IOP measurements were masked to randomization. The following parameters were calculated: the unadjusted IOP change (IOP in the randomized eye at the first on-treatment visit minus IOP in the same eye at the initiation of the monocular trial); the adjusted IOP change (the unadjusted IOP change minus the comparable IOP change in the untreated fellow eye between the same 2 visits); and the long-term IOP change (the difference of the mean of the 2 on-treatment IOP values during bilateral use and the mean of the 2 pretreatment IOP values). Main Outcome Measure: The relationship between short- and long-term IOP reduction, with the coefficient of determination (the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient, r) as the measure of association. Results: The mean long-term IOP reduction after latanoprost therapy was -3.4+/-2.4 mmHg in first-treated eyes (P<0.0001) and -3.4+/-2.4 mmHg in second-treated eyes (P<0.0001). The mean unadjusted IOP reduction in the monocular trial eye was -3.1+/-3.4 mmHg; the correlation between the unadjusted IOP change and the long-term IOP change was weak to moderate (coefficient of determination 0.325). The mean adjusted IOP reduction was -2.8+/-4.3 mmHg; the correlation between the adjusted IOP change and the long-term IOP change was also weak to moderate (coefficient of determination 0.279). Conclusions: The practice of adjusting the IOP change in the treated eye by the IOP change in the untreated eye-the monocular drug trial-is no more informative than using the treated eye's unadjusted IOP change, and both of these methods are poor predictors of long-term IOP reduction with latanoprost.

Intraocular pressure was measured and automatic static perimetry (Humphrey Field Analyser, 24-2, full threshold, short wavelength automated perimetry SWAP) and contrast sensitivity (CSV 1000, Vector Vision) was performed. Results: Intraocular pressure was significantly decreased by all medications (p<0.01) compared to baseline. No significant difference was found between medications. AVP was significantly prolonged to healthy reference data at baseline visit (p<0.0001). Dorzolamide therapy induced a significant reduction of the AVP (p=0.008) compared to baseline. No significant reduction was found for timolol and latanoprost. Peripapillary diameters remained unaffected at all visits. Visual Field Indices (white-white and SWAP) showed no statistical difference between visits. Contrast sensitivity (6 cycles per degree) was significantly higher in dorzolamide compared to timolol (p=0.04). Conclusions: Dorzolamide induces a reduction of the AVP. The prolongation of the AVP is known to correlate with progression of disease (glaucoma, diabetes mellitus, vein occlusions). Therefore a reduction of the AVP might be benefitial in these diseases."

RESULTS: Baseline mean IOP levels were similar across the groups. By week 8, reductions were observed in all 3 groups (P<0.001 for each). Travoprost-treated patients' IOP levels were reduced 8.7 and 8.1 mm Hg at 8 and 10 AM, respectively. Latanoprost-treated patients experienced 4.8 and 5.3 mm Hg reductions, whereas bimatoprost-treated patients experienced 5.5 and 4.9 mm Hg reductions at these time points. The amount of IOP reduction seen at 8 and 10 AM in travoprost group was significantly higher when compared with latanoprost and bimatoprost-treated group (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Latanoprost, bimatoprost, and travoprost were comparable in their ability to reduce IOP in open-angle glaucoma patients. On the basis of our data, the IOP reduction of these drugs is indistinguishable within statistical parameters."

Patients received bimatoprost 0.03% (n = 119) or latanoprost 0.005% (n = 113) once daily in the evening for 3 months. Visits were at prestudy, baseline (day 0), week 1, and months 1, 2, and 3. Primary outcome measures were mean IOP and the percentage of patients achieving IOP of 17 mm Hg or lower at 8:00 AM. Secondary outcome measures were diurnal IOP measurements (8:00 AM, 12 noon, 4:00 PM, 8:00 PM) at month 3 and safety measures including adverse events. Mean IOP was lower with bimatoprost than with latanoprost at all time points during the 3-month follow-up, although the between-group difference was not always statistically significant. At month 3 at 12 noon, mean IOP was as much as 1.0 mm Hg lower with bimatoprost (P = .021). Target pressures of < or = 17 mm Hg were reached more often with bimatoprost than with latanoprost at 8:00 AM (53% vs 43%; P = .029). Over all diurnal measurements at month 3, low target pressures of < or = 13, < or = 14, and < or = 15 mm Hg were achieved significantly more often with bimatoprost (P < or = .006). Both drugs were safe and well tolerated. Conjunctival hyperemia was more common with bimatoprost, while headache was more frequent with latanoprost. Bimatoprost provided lower mean pressures than latanoprost at every time point throughout the study and was statistically superior in achieving low target pressures. More patients reached low target pressures with bimatoprost."

EFFECTS ON INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE IN PRIMARY OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA AFTER COMBINED THERAPY WITH LATANOPROST AND BIMATOPROST: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL	IOVS	 	2004	45ARVO E-abstract 5540	 	 	 	"Purpose: To evaluate the effect of the association of bimatoprost to latanoprost on intraocular pressure in primary open-angle glaucoma. Methods: A twelve-week open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted including sixteen patients (32 eyes) with primary open-angle glaucoma. In the first 4 weeks, latanoprost 0.005% was prescribed for both eyes of the participants, any other ocular hypotensive drug was, discontinued and the intraocular pressure at the end of this period was considered the baseline value. After that period, the participants were conducted to the phase 1 (4 weeks duration), in which bimatoprost0.03% was associated to latanoprost in one randomly assigned eye (case group) of each patient, and only latanoprost was instilled in the fellow eye (control group). In the phase 2 (4 weeks duration), bimatoprost was discontinued from the case group, and in the control group, bimatoprost was substituted for latanoprost. The intraocular pressure was measured weekly in the phases 1 and 2. Results: At the end of the phase 1, there was a mean increase in intraocular pressure of 1.7 mmHg (95% Confidence Interval: 0.1 - 3.3 ; p=0.030) on the case group (bimatoprost+latanoprost) which returned to baseline values after discontinuation of bimatoprost (phase 2). There was no statistically significant alteration in intraocular pressure of the control group in both phases. Conclusions: The adjunctive use of bimatoprost and latanoprost in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma causes an increase in the intraocular pressure. The association of these two drugs is not recommended for treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma."

METHODS: Four hundred ninety-two patients with ocular hypertension, primary open-angle glaucoma, exfoliative glaucoma, or pigmentary glaucoma participated in this randomized, observer-masked, multicenter study. Following 3 weeks of timolol monotherapy, patients with a peak IOP of > or = 2 mm Hg were randomized to receive either fixed combination dorzolamide/timolol twice daily or concomitant brimonidine plus timolol twice daily for 3 months. The IOP-lowering effects at peak and trough, tolerability, and patient-reported convenience and satisfaction were measured at months 1 and 3. RESULTS: At month 3 peak, the dorzolamide/timolol group had an adjusted mean (SE) change from baseline IOP of -4.30 (0.24) mm Hg versus -5.27 (0.23) mm Hg in the brimonidine-plus-timolol group, with a treatment difference of 0.97 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.40, 1.53). At the month 3 trough timepoint and both month 1 timepoints, the 95% CIs of the treatment differences were within the prespecified comparability boundary of +/- 1.5 mm Hg. The incidence of drug-related adverse experiences was similar between treatment groups. Patient-reported assessments of convenience and satisfaction showed no statistically significant differences between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The IOP-lowering effect of the dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination and concomitant brimonidine plus timolol were comparable at 3 of the 4 timepoints measured.

Method: Double-masked, multicentre, active-controlled study in which 560 patients were randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to UI, TM and BH, respectively. Primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in mean 12-hour diurnal IOP, defined as the mean of the morning, mid-morning, afternoon and evening IOP values. Safety was assessed by comprehensive ophthalmic examination, vital signs, and adverse events. Results: All 3 treatments provided a clinically and statistically significant reduction in IOP after 12 months of treatment: -4.1 mm Hg, and -5.0 mm Hg with UI, TM and BH, respectively. The IOP-lowering effect of UI was clinically equivalent to that of BH. (?=0.84; 95% confidence interval =[0.30, 1.39]) after 12 months of therapy. The difference between the IOP-lowering effect of TM and UI was in favor of TM by 1.8 mm Hg; (confidence interval = [1.20, 2.291) Burning/stinging was the most frequently reported adverse event and was more common with BH (25.5%) than with UI (21.8%) and TM (15.1%). There was one case of iris color change after 12 months of treatment with UI (0.18%); there were no clinically relevant changes in eyelash length or density, and no reports of eyelid or eyelash pigmentation changes.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study design: prospective, investigator-masked, two-center, randomized clinical trial lasting 3 months. Eligibility criteria: open-angle glaucoma; IOP > or = 21 mm Hg upon the combination of a non-selective beta-blocker with pilocarpine or dorzolamide or both; no previous bulbar surgery; and prior glaucoma therapy lasting at least 2 years. Two treatment arms: (1) addition of latanoprost 0.005% QD to the pre-existing therapy [group A]; (2) substitution with latanoprost alone [group B]. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six eyes (68 eyes/treatment group) were randomized according to intraocular pressure level and the number of adjunctive medications to beta blocker. Both treatments provided a significant IOP decrease over baseline (from 23.5 +/- 1.4 to 19.7 +/- 1.9 mm Hg in group A, (P < 0.001); from 23.2 +/- 1.3 to 20.1 +/- 2.2 mm Hg in group B (P < 0.001), paired Student t test). At the end of the follow-up period, group A showed a higher number of intraocular readings less than or equal to 18 mm Hg than group B (42.6% vs. 30.8%; Fisher exact test: P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: In eyes showing an intraocular pressure greater than 21 mm Hg upon combination therapy, the substitution of the pre-existing treatment with latanoprost can provide a significant IOP decrease. However, adding latanoprost to the pre-existing therapy is more likely to achieve a target intraocular pressure less than or equal to 18 mm Hg.

Patients were randomised to receive the two concentrations of drug in the order ABA or BAB. The study period was 12 weeks for each patient, with changes in drug concentration at 4 and 8 weeks. IOPs were measured at the same time every 2 weeks. Mean IOP of both eyes was used, excluding any eyes with initial IOPs of less than 30 mmHg. There was no difference between the 2-week and 4-week pressure readings, which were therefore combined. There was no statistically significant difference in the initial IOPs of the two groups (0.5%, 33.45 mmHg; 0.25%, 32.63 mmHg) nor in the initial fall in IOP with either concentration (0.5%, 12.03 mmHg; 0.25%,11.31 mmHg). Furthermore, changing from one concentration to the other had no significant effect on IOP. Mean IOPs over the whole study period averaged 21.12 mmHg for timolol 0.25% and 20.75 mmHg for timolol 0.5%. Again these differences were not statistically significant. The statistical power of the study was estimated to exceed 85%. The authors suggest that there is no justification for use of the 0.5% strength, which is more expensive and has no advantages."

METHODS: This was a prospective, comparative, and unmasked study. For 12 months, 38 eyes of 19 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma received brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, and 40 eyes of 20 patients received timolol maleate 0.5%. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured every 2 months, and RNFL thickness was assessed using Scanning laser polarimetry (GDx) at baseline and at 12 months. RESULTS: Mean IOP reduction was similar in both groups. Within each treatment group, the RNFL thickness for ellipse average (P = 0.004), superior (P = 0.035), temporal (P = 0.003), inferior (P < 0.0001), and nasal averages (P = 0.044) were significantly decreased from baseline in timolol at 12 months. However, the RNFL thickness for ellipse average and four quadrants showed no significant change from baseline in brimonidine. The between-group difference in RNFL change showed a significant reduction for ellipse average (P = 0.02), temporal (P = 0.005), and inferior averages (P = 0.016) following timolol therapy, as compared to brimonidine. CONCLUSIONS: There appear to be less progression for RNFL damage following brimonidine 0.2% therapy compared to timolol 0.5% in ocular hypertensive patients over 1 year.

METHODS: We treated 41 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with latanoprost 0.005% for 1 month and then randomized each to either placebo or unoprostone isopropyl 0.12% for 8 weeks. Diurnal intraocular pressures were measured at 08:00, 10:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 20:00 hours, both at baseline (time of randomization) and after 8 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Twenty patients were treated in the placebo group and 21 in the unoprostone isopropyl group. After 8 weeks of treatment in the placebo group, the trough intraocular pressure at 08:00 and the diurnal pressure were 20.4 +/- 3.2 and 19.1 +/- 2.2 mm Hg, respectively. In the unoprostone isopropyl group the pressures were 19.4 +/- 3.3 and 18.0 +/- 1.7 mm Hg (P = .22 and P = .042), respectively. However, eyes with a baseline pressure of 22 mm Hg or greater on latanoprost had an average 3.3 mm Hg greater reduction at trough (P < .01) and a 2.1 mm Hg greater decrease in diurnal pressure (P = .030) after adding unoprostone isopropyl (n = 14 eyes) compared with placebo (n = 16 eyes; P < .001). In addition, the range of the pressures throughout the diurnal curve was reduced from 2.7 mm Hg on latanoprost alone to 1.4 mm Hg after adding unoprostone isopropyl. Adverse events were similar between groups, and no patients were discontinued because of safety reasons. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that unoprostone isopropyl can safely improve the diurnal curve characteristics in patients who continue to have an elevated pressure on latanoprost 0.005% alone.

Ocular hypotensive effect and safety of brinzolamide ophthalmic solution in open angle glaucoma patients	Journal of the Formosan Medical Association	J.Formosan Med.Assoc.	2004	103	5	369	373	"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brinzolamide is a new topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor for intraocular pressure (IOP) control. It has high inhibitory activity against human carbonic anhydrase II, which is the key isoenzyme regulating aqueous humor production. We conducted this study to compare the ocular hypotensive effect and safety of 1% brinzolamide versus that of 0.5% timolol twice daily. METHODS: In a double-masked design, 50 open angle glaucoma patients who had a baseline IOP between 20 to 30 mm Hg were randomized to receive either 1% brinzolamide ophthalmic solution or 0.5% timolol twice daily. After completing a 2-week pre-study screening period, patients were scheduled to receive 6 weeks of treatment. Visual acuity, IOP, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, corneal thickness, refraction status, blood pressure, heart rate, and treatment-related signs and symptoms were evaluated at follow-up visits. The eye selected for treatment was the one with the higher baseline IOP, or the right eye if the IOPs were the same in both eyes. The fellow eye served as control. RESULTS: 48 patients completed the study, and there were 24 patients in each group. A significant decrease in mean IOP was found after 6 weeks of treatment in both the brinzolamide group (-17.0%) and the timolol group (-19.7%), with no significant between-group difference in the control of IOP. The central corneal thickness of treatment eyes, measured by ultrasound pachometry, had not changed after 6 weeks of brinzolamide treatment. The study medications were generally well tolerated and no serious adverse reactions occurred during the 6-week study period. CONCLUSION: When used twice a day, topical brinzolamide is as effective as 0.5% timolol in lowering IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma.

METHODS: One hundred seventy-six patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma were randomly assigned to receive either carteolol 1% twice a day or timolol maleate 0.5% solution twice a day in a randomized, double-masked, multicenter, parallel-group, active-control comparison trial during a 3-month period. RESULTS: After 12 weeks, carteolol 1% reduced the mean +/- SE intraocular pressure from 25.0 +/- 0.3 to 19.5 +/- 0.3 mm Hg; timolol maleate 0.5% reduced the mean intraocular pressure from 25.2 +/- 0.3 to 19.6 +/- 0.3 mm Hg. The mean difference in trough intraocular pressure between carteolol and timolol maleate of -0.14 mm Hg was not significantly (P = .745) different (95% confidence limits, -0.97 to 0.70 mm Hg). Trough pulse and blood pressure also showed no consistent statistically significant differences between groups. The 2-hour postdose pulse, however, demonstrated a greater decrease in the timolol maleate than in the carteolol group (P < .001). Systemic and ocular signs and symptoms were similar between the groups except that the number of treatment-emergent reports of bradycardia was greater in the timolol maleate group (P = .039), and the carteolol group reported fewer ocular symptoms than the timolol maleate group did (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Both carteolol 1% and timolol maleate 0.5% are highly effective in lowering intraocular pressure when measured at the end of the dosing interval.

METHODS: 175 patients with bilateral POAG or OHT were randomised: 87 patients were to receive one drop daily of T-Gel 0.1% MD and 88 patients were to receive one drop daily of T-Gel 0.1% SDU, for a treatment period of 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the change in intraocular pressure (IOP) in the worse eye between the baseline and the last assessment. Subjective and objective ocular signs as well as adverse events were recorded for safety. Global tolerance was assessed by the investigator and by the patient. RESULTS: The mean percentage reduction from baseline IOP was 24% for both treatments groups, which was consistent with previous studies. The safety results were comparable in both treatment groups. Because of gel formulation, mild short lasting episodes of blurred vision occurred for about 20% of patients. The global tolerance assessment reported that both treatments were well tolerated.

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seventy-seven patients with a diagnosis of glaucoma or ocular hypertension and inadequate control of intraocular pressure (IOP) after at least 2 weeks of topical timolol maleate 0.5% monotherapy. METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive bimatoprost 0.03% once daily (n = 90) or combined timolol 0.5% and dorzolamide 2% twice daily (n = 87) over a 3-month period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraocular pressure, the primary end point, was measured at 8 AM and 10 AM at baseline, week 1, and months 1, 2, and 3, and also at 4 PM and 8 PM at baseline and month 3. RESULTS: Bimatoprost provided significantly greater IOP lowering compared with combined timolol and dorzolamide. At the 8 AM measurements, bimatoprost lowered mean IOP 6.8 mmHg to 7.6 mmHg from baseline, whereas combined timolol and dorzolamide lowered mean IOP 4.4 to 5.0 mmHg from baseline (P<0.001). At the last follow-up, patients had better diurnal IOP control with bimatoprost than combined timolol and dorzolamide. At 8 AM at the 3-month visit, the percentages of patients achieving IOPs of <or =13 mmHg, < or =14 mmHg, < or =15 mmHg, or < or =16 mmHg were more than twice as high for bimatoprost than for combined timolol and dorzolamide (all P< or =0.008). Taste perversion, ocular burning, and stinging with instillation were more common with combined timolol and dorzolamide, whereas conjunctival hyperemia was more common with bimatoprost. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, uncontrolled on a topical beta-blocker alone, bimatoprost lowered IOP more consistently than did combined timolol and dorzolamide."

Intraocular pressure-lowering effects of latanoprost and brimonidine therapy in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension: a randomized observer-masked multicenter study	 	"Journal of Glaucoma.11(2)(pp 90-96), 2002.Date of Publication: 2002."	 	 	 	 	 	"Purpose: To compare the effect of treatment with latanoprost or brimonidine on intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension and intraocular pressure inadequately controlled by monotherapy or dual therapy. Patients and Methods: Three hundred seventy-nine patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were recruited for this 6-month prospective, randomized, observer-masked multicenter study involving 30 eye clinics. All patients were receiving monotherapy or dual therapy that did not adequately control intraocular pressure. After appropriate washout periods, patients were randomized to treatment with latanoprost once daily or brimonidine twice daily. The main outcome measure was change in mean diurnal intraocular pressure after 6 months of treatment compared with baseline. Results: Of the 379 randomized patients, 375 were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. From an overall baseline mean intraocular pressure of 25.0 mm Hg, latanoprost monotherapy reduced mean diurnal intraocular pressure by 7.1 +/- 3.3 mm Hg (mean +/- SD, P < 0.001), whereas brimonidine monotherapy yielded an intraocular-pressure reduction of 5.2 +/- 3.5 mm Hg (P < 0.001). This 1.9 mm Hg difference in intraocular-pressure reduction was significantly in favor of latanoprost (P < 0.001). Ocular allergy (P < 0.001) and systemic side effects (P = 0.005) were reported significantly less frequently by latanoprost-treated patients compared with brimonidine-treated patients. Conclusions: Both latanoprost and brimonidine reduced intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension after 6 months of treatment. However, latanoprost once daily was significantly more effective than brimonidine twice daily in reducing mean diurnal intraocular pressure. Latanoprost was better tolerated with less frequently occurring ocular allergy and systemic side effects."

"PURPOSE: We determined whether the addition of topical apraclonidine hydrochloride to eyes that are receiving maximal medical therapy but still have inadequate intraocular pressure control and that are scheduled to undergo surgery could adequately decrease intraocular pressure, postponing the need for further intervention. METHODS: We performed a prospective, 90- day, multicentered, placebo-controlled, double-masked parallel study. We enrolled one eye each of 174 glaucoma patients with inadequate intraocular pressure control who were on maximally tolerated medical therapy. We continued to administer maximum medical therapy for glaucoma. Study medications were either apraclonidine hydrochloride 0.5% or placebo (apraclonidine's vehicle). Patients were instructed to take the study medication every eight hours. We measured intraocular pressure, change in intraocular pressure from baseline, and the number of eyes requiring surgery after the addition of study medication. RESULTS: Fifty-two (60%) of 86 patients treated with apraclonidine maintained adequate intraocular pressure control throughout the study and avoided surgery, compared with 28 (32%) of 88 patients treated with placebo (P < .001). Apraclonidine treatment resulted in significantly more patients attaining an additional 20% reduction or more in intraocular pressure from baseline and an intraocular pressure less than or equal to 20 mm Hg (P < .05). The most common ocular complication was conjunctival hyperemia (11 of 86 patients, 12.8%). The most frequent nonocular problem was dry mouth (four patients, 4.7%). CONCLUSION: Apraclonidine appeared to be safe in all eyes and efficacious in some eyes. It significantly lowered intraocular pressure when used in combination with maximally tolerated medical therapy, which delayed or prevented further glaucoma surgery for at least 90 days in 52 (60%) of 86 treated patients."

METHODS: An 8-week, prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative study was performed in 58 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma treated by latanoprost, timolol, and dorzolamide. These patients were randomly enrolled into two groups: (1) dorzolamide three times daily was substituted with brinzolamide twice-daily (substituting group); and (2) dorzolamide three times daily was continued (control group). Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at baseline, 4, and 8 weeks after the enrollment. Subjective ocular discomfort (irritation and blurred vision) at the time of the instillation of the patient was noted with interview. RESULTS: The IOPs at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks after the enrollment were 17.7 +/- 2.7 mmHg, 17.5 +/- 2.6 mmHg, and 17.4 +/- 2.9 mmHg in the substituting group, and 18.0 +/- 2.5 mmHg, 17.8 +/- 2.5 mmHg, and 17.9 +/- 2.6 mmHg in the control group, respectively. There were no significant differences in IOP changes between the two groups (P = 0.74). In the substituting group, ocular irritation was decreased significantly (P = 0.0014) from 63% to 20%. The slight increase of blurred vision from 27% to 37% that occurred in the substituting group was not significant (P = 0.58). In the control group, neither ocular irritation (P = 0.58, from 68% to 57%) nor blurred vision (P = 0.99, from 25% to 21%) was changed.

"In a 12-week double-masked trial we compared the ocular hypotensive effect of 0.25% timolol in Gelrite administered once daily (TG) to that of 0.25% timolol solution administered twice daily (TS). A second objective was to compare the tolerability and the safety of these treatments. Timolol in Gelrite is a new topical formulation of timolol in an anionic heteropolysaccharide gellan gum. A total of 156 patients entered the study after an appropriate wash-out. The medication schedule included one drop of test drug in each eye at 9 a.m. (active drug for both groups) and 9 p.m. (placebo for the TG group, active drug for the TS group). At trough, the mean decrease from baseline intraocular pressure (after appropriate wash-out) ranged from 5.7 to 6.3 mmHg for the TG group and from 5.8 to 6.2 mmHg for the TS group. The difference between the treatment group means ranged from -0.4 to 0.4 mmHg. At peak, the mean decrease from baseline IOP ranged from 5.3 to 6.2 mmHg for TG group and from 5.1 to 6.1 mmHg for the TS group. The difference between the treatment group means ranged from -0.7 to 0.4 mmHg. The results of this study support the hypothesis of the comparable hypotensive effect at peak and trough of 0.25% timolol in Gelrite q.d. to 0.25% timolol solution b.i.d. Furthermore, timolol in Gelrite has an acceptable tolerability profile. The incidence of blurred vision was higher in the Gelrite group, but this difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of foreign body sensation was significantly higher in the Gelrite group (P < 0.022). In conclusion, the new formulation of timolol in Gelrite q.d. has comparable efficacy to timolol solution b.i.d. in lowering IOP with a similar safety profile, although there is a higher incidence of foreign body sensation in the Gelrite group."

A gellan formulation of timolol maleate is given once daily and has been shown to be as effective as timolol maleate solution, but is associated with ocular symptoms that may limit its utility. A new timolol maleate solution has been formulated that contains potassium sorbate (timolol-LA [TLA; Istalol(R)]) to enhance the ocular bioavailability of timolol instilled into the eye, as well as half the benzalkonium chloride preservative found in timolol maleate. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this trial was to assess the ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety profile of TLA 0.5% solution once daily with those of timolol maleate ophthalmic solution (TIM) 0.5% twice daily in patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT). METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted at 21 participating private practices across the United States. Patients aged > or =18 years with OAG or OHT in 1 or both eyes and an unmedicated intraocular pressure (IOP) of > or =22 mm Hg were randomized to receive either TLA once daily or TIM twice daily bilaterally for 12 months. The primary outcome measure was IOP (95% CIs) on treatment difference at each visit (ie, equivalence analysis). The safety profile was assessed based on biomicroscopic and ophthalmoscopic examination and patient symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 332 patients (203 women, 129 men; mean [SEM] age, 64.6 [11.8] years [range, 29-92 years]) entered the study. Of these, 290 patients (87.3%) completed it. At none of the visits did the 95% CIs for between-treatment comparisons exceed 1.5 mm Hg and, at most of the visits, these intervals did not exceed 1.0 mm Hg. Mean baseline IOP was approximately 25 mm Hg in both groups. IOP was reduced at all posttreatment visits to 18 to 19 mm Hg at peak and to approximately 19 to 20 mm Hg at trough drug level in both treatment groups. Mean reductions from baseline were 6 to 7 mm Hg at peak and 5 to 6 mm Hg at trough (25.5%-28.7% and 20.8%-24.7%, respectively). Seventeen patients (5.1%) withdrew due to adverse events (AEs) (10 patients [6.0%] and 7 patients [4.2%] in the TLA and TIM groups, respectively). Based on biomicroscopic and ophthalmoscopic examination and volunteered symptoms, the safety profile was similar between the 2 treatments, except for burning and stinging on instillation, with an incidence of 41.6% in the TLA group and 22.9% in the TIM group (P = 0.001). Nearly all cases of burning and stinging were mild (94.2% [65 events] with TLA and 90.0% [36 events] with TIM), and none of the patients discontinued treatment due to this AE. Conclusions: TLA solution, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, given once daily in the morning, was found to be statistically equivalent in ocular hypotensive efficacy (as defined a priori) compared with TIM, given twice daily, and with an acceptable safety profile in this study population of adult patients.

METHODS: This was a randomized, comparative, investigator-masked study. Patients with OAG or OHT treated with travoprost 0.004% monotherapy were randomized to receive 1 of the 3 adjunctive therapies (timolol maleate 0.5%, brinzolamide 1%, or brimonidine tartrate 0.2%), 1 drop BID in each randomized eye, in addition to 1 drop QD of travoprost for a period of 4 weeks. IOP was measured on days 0 (travoprost 0.004%) and 28 (travoprost 0.004% and adjunctive treatment). Adverse events were monitored on days 0 and 28 by patient interview. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with OAG (46 eyes) and 3 patients with OHT (6 eyes), with a total of 52 eligible eyes, completed the study; 28 eyes were from male patients and 24 were from female patients. In addition to continuing travoprost treatment, 20 eyes received timolol, 16 eyes received brinzolamide, and 16 eyes were treated with brimonidine. There were no significant differences among the groups in the mean (SD) IOP at baseline on day 0 (19.0 [4.1], 17.2 [3.5], and 17.0 [3.1] mm Hg, respectively; P=NS). On day 28, the reduction in mean (SD) IOP in eyes treated with brimonidine tartrate 0.2% was significantly smaller (2.3 [1.8] mm Hg vs 3.9 [1.8] mm Hg [P=0.01]) and the mean (SD) percentage reduction in IOP was significantly smaller (13.4% [9.1%] vs 20.2% [7.5%] [P=0.01]) when compared with timolol maleate 0.5%, and likewise when compared with brinzolamide 1% (4.0 [2.1] mm Hg [P=0.02] and 22.7% [8.6%] [P=0.006], respectively). The group treated with brinzolamide was associated with a similar reduction in IOP to timolol (P=NS for both mean [SD] IOP and percentage reduction in IOP compared with timolol monotherapy). Barring the occasional conjunctival hyperemia, which was excluded as an adverse event for the purposes of this study, no adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSION: Brinzolamide 1% and timolol maleate 0.5% treatment were both associated with a significantly greater reduction in IOP compared with brimonidine 0.2% when administered as a nonfixed adjuvant to travoprost 0.004% in the treatment of patients with OAG and OHT whose IOP was inadequately controlled with travoprost monotherapy.

No statistical difference between treatments was observed at any individual time-point except at 10.00 hours, when the PTFC group demonstrated an IOP of 15.9 +/- 2.3 mmHg and latanoprost 16.8 +/- 2.7 mmHg (p = 0.02). There were no statistical differences between groups in unsolicited systemic or ocular adverse events (p > 0.05). However, the PTFC group showed a narrower pupil diameter (2.3 mm) than the latanoprost group (3.7 mm). Additionally, a solicited symptom survey demonstrated mild blurred vision, stinging and ocular pain with PTFC (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Both PTFC and latanoprost are efficacious in reducing diurnal IOP in POAG or OH. However, PTFC may be more effective in the late morning and may have a greater incidence of mild ocular side-effects."

Latanoprost vs combined therapy with timolol plus dorzolamide in open-angle glaucoma: a 24-month study	Annals of Ophthalmology	Ann.Ophthalmol.	2005	37	1	33	36	"Objective: To compare the long-term efficacy and short-term escape from effective treatment of 0.005% latanoprost administered once daily vs 0.5% timolol plus 2% dorzolamide twice daily for 24 months to patients with open-angle glaucoma. Design: Prospective study. Setting and number of patients: A total of 117 eyes of 61 subjects with open-angle glaucoma were included in this study. The eligible patients were randomized to receive either 0.005% latanoprost once daily or 0.5% timolol and 2% dorzolamide twice daily. Measurements: The intraocular pressure (IOP) figures were recorded at baseline and at 0. 5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months of treatment. Results: Compared with baseline measurements, both latanoprost and timolol plus dorzolamide treatments caused a significant (p < 0.001) reduction of IOP at each visit throughout the duration of therapy. The IOP was reduced to 17.1 +/- 2.4, 16.6 +/- 2.2, and 15.9 +/- 2.04 with latanoprost and 18.2 +/- 2.1, 18.6 +/- 2.4, and 18.4 +/- 1.9 with timolol plus dorzolamide after 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. After 24 months, 82% of the patients who initially responded to treatment were still controlled in the latanoprost group, with a maintained reduction of IOP and no signs of upward drift. However, only 56% of the patients of the timolol plus dorzolamide group were controlled at the end of the study with increase of IOP figures. Conclusions: Administered once daily, 0.005% latanoprost is more effective than timolol plus dorzolamide twice daily for the long-term treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma, showing a maintained effect on IOP reduction.

"PURPOSE. To compare the efficacy and safety of timolol maleate 0.5% versus brinzolamide 1% when added to travoprost 0.004% in patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma. DESIGN. A prospective, double-masked, randomized, active-controlled, parallel comparison. METHODS. Qualified patients at Visit 1 were placed on travoprost dosed every evening for 4 weeks and then were randomized at baseline (Visit 2) to the addition of timolol maleate or brinzolamide each given twice daily. Patients returned to clinic at Week 4 (Visit 3) for a safety visit and Week 12 (Visit 4) for an efficacy visit. At Visits 2 and 4 the intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at 08:00, 12:00, and 16:00 hours. RESULTS. Ninety-seven patients on brinzolamide had a baseline diurnal IOP of 21.5+/-2.2 mmHg and 95 on timolol maleate had 21.3+/-2.5 mmHg, each added to travoprost. The diurnal mean IOP at Week 12 was 18.1+/-2.7 mmHg for brinzolamide and 18.1+/-3.0 mmHg for timolol maleate (p=0.96). There was no statistical difference found between treatment groups in the absolute level of pressure, or in the reduction in IOP from baseline, at each time point or for the diurnal curve (p>0.05). There was no significant difference for any adverse event between groups (p>0.05), with the most common side effect being conjunctival hyperemia in 15/97 (16%) brinzolamide and 6/95 (6%) timolol treated patients (p=0.06).

DESIGN: Four-week, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel, three-center study. SETTING: Referral centers. PATIENTS: Forty-eight patients with bilateral open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and intraocular pressure (IOP) greater than 22 mm Hg entered the study. Two of 28 patients receiving dorzolamide and two of 20 patients receiving placebo were withdrawn due to adverse experiences. INTERVENTION: Dorzolamide (2%) or placebo to each eye three times daily for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diurnal IOP curves; ophthalmologic evaluations including corneal ultrasound pachymetry and endothelial cell count; and systemic evaluations including vital signs, blood chemistries, complete blood cell counts, urinalysis, electrocardiogram, and drug and carbonic anhydrase activity levels in red blood cells. RESULTS: Mean IOP at morning trough (8 AM) decreased from 27.1 mm Hg at baseline to 23.5 mm Hg on day 29 with dorzolamide (-13.3%) compared with a decrease from 27.1 mm Hg to 26.4 mm Hg with placebo (-2.3%). Peak activity occurred 2 hours after administration, with IOP decreasing from 26.8 mm Hg at baseline to 21.8 mm Hg on day 29 with dorzolamide (-18.4%) vs 26.1 mm Hg to 25.5 (-2.4%) with placebo. Mean corneal thickness was slightly increased for the dorzolamide-treated group compared with the placebo-treated group (0.009 mm vs 0.001 mm, respectively, P  .25). Mean carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme II activity in red blood cells decreased to 21% of baseline in dorzolamide-treated patients. There were no clinically significant differences in ocular or laboratory parameters between the dorzolamide and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: Dorzolamide demonstrated significant IOP lowering activity over 4 weeks. It was well tolerated and there were no clinically significant changes in ocular or systemic safety parameters.

Methods: Randomized, single-center, investigator-masked, parallel-group clinical study. Patients with IOP [greater-than or equal to] 18 mmHg while on once-daily latanoprost were randomized to adjunctive treatment with brimonidine purite TID (n = 20) or brinzolamide TID (n = 20) for 3 months. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at 8 a.m., 10 a.m., and 4 p.m. at latanoprost-treated baseline and after 1 and 3 months of latanoprost and adjunctive therapy. A patient questionnaire was administered to evaluate the tolerability of eye drop instillation. Results: Baseline mean diurnal IOP (+/- standard deviation, mmHg) on latanoprost was comparable between groups (brimonidine purite: 19.6 +/- 2.94; brinzolamide: 19.8 +/- 3.25; p= 0.846). Mean diurnal IOP at Month 3 was 16.3 +/- 2.63 mmHg with brimonidine purite and 17.8 +/- 2.19 mmHg with brinzolamide (p = 0.028). Adjunctive use of brimonidine purite provided greater IOP lowering than brinzolamide at 10 a.m. (p < 0.001) and 4 p.m. (p = 0.050) and equivalent IOP lowering to brinzolamide at 8 a.m. (p = 0.716). Blurred vision at Month 1 and bitter taste at Months 1 and 3 were more common upon instillation of brinzolamide eye drops. Conclusion: Brimonidine purite 0.1% provided significantly lower IOP compared with brinzolamide 1% when used as adjunctive therapy to latanoprost. Both adjunctive therapies were well tolerated. Limitations of this study include the use of a single site and the sample size. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate these drugs as adjunctive therapy to prostaglandin analogs. copyright 2008 Informa UK Ltd. All rights reserved."

METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, crossover comparison was performed in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. After at least a 4-week run-in period with latanoprost 0.005% (Xalatan, Pharmacia & Upjohn, Kalamazoo, Michigan), both eyes from 30 patients (60 eyes) were randomly assigned to one of the two adjunctive therapies, timolol hemihydrate or timolol maleate gel for 6 weeks. At the end of the first period, the study medicine was discontinued for a 2-week washout period. Patients then received the opposite medication for the second 6-week period. This study had an 80% power to exclude a 1-mm Hg difference between groups. RESULTS: The baseline intraocular pressure after 1 month of latanoprost treatment only for all 30 subjects was 20.8 +/- 2.6 mm Hg. After 6 weeks of timolol hemihydrate, the 24-hour trough intraocular pressure was 17.5 +/- 3.4 mm Hg, and for timolol maleate gel, 17.9 +/- 3.5 mm Hg (P = .74).

The patients were followed for an average of 56 and 51 months, respectively. Criteria for failure were a confirmed IOP of greater than 32 mmHg, stereophotographically documented optic nerve progression, or development of glaucomatous visual field loss by Goldmann or Octopus perimetry. Nine patients failed in the TT group and 17 in the NT group (P = 0.07). Of the nine TT group failures, six had discontinued timolol before failure (4 for greater than 6 months). In a Cox proportional hazards analysis controlling for confounding variables, timolol was found to be significantly protective with an adjusted risk ratio of 0.38 (95% confidence interval = 0.16-0.89, P = 0.03). When only field and disc failure criteria were considered, timolol treatment was found to be significantly protective in an analysis considering patients who stopped timolol as being lost to follow-up (P = 0.05). A higher tonographic facility of outflow was protective in all analyses. A trend toward a substantial loss of effectiveness of timolol on IOP was not observed. Seasonal fluctuations in IOP were observed (P = 0.0007), with higher IOP occurring in the winter. The results demonstrate a favorable influence of timolol therapy on the clinical course of patients with mildly elevated IOP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

DESIGN: This was a randomized, multicenter, investigator-masked, prospective, parallel-group, clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. INTERVENTION: After washout of any previous ocular hypotensive medications, patients were randomly assigned to treatment with bimatoprost 0.03% ophthalmic solution QD (n=38) or latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution QD (n=38) between 7 and 9 pm, or timolol maleate 0.5% gel-forming ophthalmic solution QD (n=39) between 7 and 9 am for 1 month.

IOP was also measured at 8 am and 10 am at baseline and at 8 am on day 14. Safety measures included adverse events, biomicroscopy, visual acuity, heart rate, and blood pressure. RESULTS: At 10 am (peak drug effect) on day 28, the mean IOP reduction from baseline was significantly greater with bimatoprost (9.3 mm Hg, 40.3%) than with timolol gel (7.1 mm Hg, 31.1%; P=.024, Wilcoxon rank sum test) or latanoprost (7.4 mm Hg, 33.3%).

METHODS: Two multi-center, randomized, cross-over, observer masked studies were conducted, one in the United States (97 patients) and one in Europe (93 patients). The Comparison of Ophthalmic Medications for Tolerability questionnaire was used to assess patient preference and perception of side effects and activity limitations resulting from study medications. Intraocular pressure was measured before and 2 hours after the morning dose of study medication (hour 0 and hour 2). RESULTS: In both studies, among patients with a preference, the combination was preterred to timolol plus pilocarpine by a ratio of 4 to 1. The most commonly cited reason for this preference was side effects. Patients in both studies also reported that the combination interfered significantly less with daily life in terms of side effects and activity limitations. They also reported missing significantly fewer doses of study medication while taking the combination and being significantly more satisfied with it. The efficacy of these two treatments was not significantly different, based on IOP measurements at hour 0 and 2 hours after administration. Patients reported significantly more adverse events while receiving timolol plus pilocarpine in both studies, and in the U.S. study, significantly more patients discontinued therapy while receiving timolol plus pilocarpine than while receiving the combination. CONCLUSION: Compared with timolol plus pilocarpine, patients preferred the combination of 2% dorzolamide/0.5% timolol, and reported less interference in daily activities, better tolerability, and better compliance with therapy.

The purpose of this study was to follow glaucoma patients treated with either betaxolol 0.5% or timolol 0.25% ophthalmic solutions and to compare the rate and degree of progression in retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) defects between the groups. METHODS: A total of 64 patients were prospectively recruited in a double-masked study and randomly divided into two treatment groups. Retinal nerve fibre layer photographs were analysed. The incidence and total amount of progression in each group were recorded. The rate of impairment was demonstrated using Kaplan Meier survival curves. RESULTS: The analysis included 27 patients treated with betaxolol and 28 patients treated with timolol. Of these, 30% of betaxolol-treated patients and 46% of timolol-treated patients had RNFL damage progression (p = 0.20). The total amount or rate of progression did not differ significantly between the two groups. There was no significant difference in intraocular pressure (IOP) levels between the groups (p = 0.68) during follow-up.

The overall mean decrease in IOP was 5.6 mm Hg (decrease of 23%) in the levobunolol group and 6.7 mm Hg (26%) in the timolol group, a nonsignificant difference. In both groups the overall mean IOP during treatment was significantly lower than the pretreatment value (p less than 0.001). For both treatment groups changes in heart rate and blood pressure were minimal. We conclude that both 0.5% levobunolol and 0.5% timolol administered once daily are effective and safe in lowering IOP in most patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.

Increase in outflow facility with unoprostone treatment in ocular hypertensive patients	Archives of Ophthalmology	Arch.Ophthalmol.	2004	122	12	1782	1787	"OBJECTIVE: To determine the mechanism by which 0.15% unoprostone isopropyl reduces intraocular pressure (IOP) by studying 33 patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma. METHODS: At baseline, IOP was determined by pneumatonometry, aqueous flow and outflow facility by fluorophotometry, episcleral venous pressure by venomanometry, and uveoscleral outflow by mathematical calculation. Unoprostone was administered to one eye and placebo to the fellow eye of each patient twice daily in a randomized masked fashion. In patients who demonstrated an IOP reduction of 3 mm Hg or more in either eye on day 5 +/- 1 (n = 29), determinations were repeated on that day and on day 28 +/- 2. Treated eyes were compared with control eyes, and treatment days were compared with baseline by paired t tests. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, unoprostone significantly (P<.001) reduced IOP by a mean +/- SEM of 5.6 +/- 0.4 mm Hg and 4.8 +/- 0.6 mm Hg on days 5 and 28, respectively. The change from baseline with unoprostone was significantly (P<.001) greater than with placebo by 2.8 +/- 0.4 mm Hg on day 5 and by 3.2 +/- 0.5 mm Hg on day 28.

DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, double-masked clinical trial. Adult patients of either sex diagnosed as having either open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were enrolled in the study. Patients using only 0.5% timolol maleate twice daily for at least 4 weeks and who had 8 AM IOPs of at least 22 mm Hg and no greater than 30 mm Hg 12 hours after dosing were eligible for the study. After 8 AM baseline IOPs were obtained while patients were taking timolol only, they were then randomized to receive either 0.5% or 1.0% apraclonidine twice daily in addition to their timolol. Intraocular pressures were measured at 8 AM (before morning dosing) and at 11 AM (3 hours after dosing) on days 14 and 90 and at 8 AM only on day 45. RESULTS: Both concentrations of apraclonidine produced significant IOP reductions from baseline at all visits (P < .001). At 8 AM, after the nighttime dose, the additional mean IOP reduction from the timolol baseline ranged from 2.5 to 3.3 mm Hg (10.3% to 13.6% reduction, respectively). At 11 AM, 3 hours after the morning dose, the additional IOP reduction from the timolol baseline ranged from 4.7 to 5.2 mm Hg (20.0% to 21.7%, respectively). No difference in IOP reduction was observed between the 0.5% and 1.0% apraclonidine concentrations and no loss of IOP efficacy was observed for either concentration for the duration of the study. Sensitivity to 0.5% and 1.0% apraclonidine was observed in nine (13.8%) and 13 (20.3%) patients, respectively. Overall, therapy was discontinued owing to ocular or nonocular side effects with 0.5% and 1.0% apraclonidine in 14 (21.5%) and 16 (25%) patients, respectively.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicentre, masked-observer, crossover comparison. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen patients with POAG and 14 with OH. METHODS: The participants of the study were washed out from their previous medication and randomized to fixed FCBT or FCDT for the first 4-week treatment period. Subjects then were washed for 4 weeks and started on the opposite medication for the second 4-week period. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured with a Goldmann applanation tonometer at 8:00 a.m., 12:00 noon and 4:00 p.m. at each baseline and at the end of each treatment period. Unsolicited ocular adverse events were also recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of the IOP lowering effect of FCBT and FCDT. RESULTS: The baseline mean diurnal IOP for all 30 subjects (30 eyes) was 22.9 +/- 1.6 mmHg. Both fixed combinations significantly reduced IOP compared with baseline (p < 0.00001). The mean diurnal IOP following 4 weeks of therapy was 15.0 +/- 2.1 mmHg for FCBT and 15.4 +/- 2.1 mmHg for FCDT (p = 0.510). The mean diurnal IOP reduction was 7.8 +/- 1.9 mmHg for FCBT and 7.4 +/- 1.8 mmHg for FCDT (p = 0.430). Overall, 14 subjects complained about ocular adverse events: two only for FCBT, seven only for FCDT and five for both drugs. Although there was no significant difference between the number of subjects that reported ocular adverse events with FCBT (n = 7) and FCDT (n = 12) (p = 0.359), FCDT caused more ocular stinging upon instillation (n = 9) than FCBT (n = 1) (p = 0.027).

DESIGN: Multicenter, parallel, randomized, double-masked clinical trial with an open-label extension. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTION: In the masked phase, 242 patients received either the dorzolamide-timolol combination twice daily and placebo three times daily or dorzolamide three times daily and timolol twice daily for up to 3 months. In the open-label extension, 220 patients received the dorzolamide-timolol combination twice daily for up to 9 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The criterion for establishing treatment equivalency was a 95% or greater confidence that the absolute difference in the mean change in IOP from baseline was less than 1.5 mmHg between treatments. RESULTS: During 3 months of treatment, the dorzolamide-timolol combination reduced IOP relative to the 0.5% timolol baseline by approximately 14% at hour 0 (just before the morning dose), 20% at hour 2, and 15% at hour 8. The IOP-lowering effect of concomitant therapy with dorzolamide and timolol was approximately 16% at hour 0, 20% at hour 2, and 17% at hour 8. At hours 0, 2, and 8, there was greater than 97% confidence that the treatments were equivalent. During the open-label extension, the mean IOP reduction ranged from 14% to 15% at hour 0 and from 20% to 21% at hour 2. The treatment groups were generally comparable in terms of adverse events, symptoms, ocular signs, visual acuity, visual fields, physical examination, and laboratory measures. CONCLUSIONS: The IOP-lowering effect of the dorzolamide-timolol combination is comparable to that of dorzolamide three times daily plus timolol twice daily and is maintained for up to 1 year. The dorzolamide-timolol combination provides clinically important reduction in IOP relative to baseline treatment with timolol alone and is generally well-tolerated for up to 1 year.

United states latanoprost study group	American Journal of Ophthalmology	Am.J.Ophthalmol.	1998	126	3	390	399	"PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy and safety of latanoprost treatment for 1 year in glaucoma patients, and to evaluate the effects of switching from timolol to latanoprost therapy. METHODS: Latanoprost 0.005% was topically applied once daily without masking for 6 months in 223 patients with elevated intraocular pressure after previous treatment with latanoprost once daily or 0.5% timolol twice daily for 6 months in a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel group study. RESULTS: Compared with baseline values before treatment, a significant (P < .0001) diurnal reduction in intraocular pressure of 6 to 8 mm Hg was maintained with minimal fluctuation for the duration of treatment. When treatment was switched from timolol to latanoprost, intraocular pressure was reduced by 1.5 +/- 0.3 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM; 8% change in intraocular pressure; 31% of the intraocular pressure reduction produced by timolol; P < .001) compared with the change in intraocular pressure in patients remaining on latanoprost therapy. Of the patients initially enrolled, 95% successfully completed treatment. There was a slight overall increase in conjunctival hyperemia in patients who switched from timolol to latanoprost, but no change in those who continued latanoprost. The timolol-induced reduction of resting heart rate returned to baseline levels after switching to latanoprost. Of the 247 patients treated with latanoprost during the masked and/or open-label studies, 12 (5%) demonstrated a definite (n = 4) or possible (n = 8) increase in iris pigmentation. CONCLUSIONS: Latanoprost is a well-tolerated ocular hypotensive agent that appears to be more effective than timolol in reducing intraocular pressure. The increase in iris pigmentation appears to be harmless but requires further investigation.

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of brinzolamide 1% versus dorzolamide 1% when added to the combination therapy of latanoprost and a beta-blocker in patients with glaucoma. METHODS: An 8-week, randomized, open-label comparative study was performed in 52 patients with glaucoma. Brinzolamide 1% (twice a day) or dorzolamide 1% (3 times a day) was randomly administered to the patients who had been treated with both latanoprost and a betablocker. RESULTS: Intraocular pressure (IOP) were both decreased significantly (P < 0.0001) from 18.6 +/- 2.3 mmHg to 16.7 +/- 2.3 mmHg and from 18.4 +/- 2.6 mmHg to 16.6 +/- 2.5 mmHg, respectively, 8 weeks after the addition of brinzolamide or dorzolamide. However, the difference between the groups was not significant (P = 0.86). The incidence of ocular irritation was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in the dorzolamide group (74%) than the brinzolamide group (16%), but there was no significant difference in blurred vision between the groups (dorzolamide 37% versus brinzolamide 52%, P = 0.40). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the efficacy of brinzolamide 1% was equivalent to dorzolamide 1%; however, the safety of brinzolamide 1% was superior to dorzolamide 1% as adjunctive therapy to the combination with latanoprost and a beta-blocker.

"The intraocular pressure reducing effect and side-effects of latanoprost, a phenyl-substituted prostaglandin analogue, were compared with those of timolol, in a group of 31 glaucomatous or ocular hypertensive patients, divided into three subgroups. The study was randomized and double masked. At the end of 6 month's treatment with latanoprost 0.005% once daily, either as a morning dose or as an evening dose, there was a reduction in intraocular pressure of 33% (p < 0.001) and 36% (p < 0.001), respectively. The intraocular pressure reduction of timolol 0.5%, administered twice daily was 26% (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in conjunctival hyperemia between the groups and there were few subjective symptoms in any of the patients. One patient with a light green-brown iris, treated with latanoprost in one eye only, exhibited an increase in iris colour in the treated eye at week 26, and did not show any signs of reversion 9 months after discontinuing the therapy. It may be concluded that latanoprost is well tolerated and at least as effective as timolol in reducing intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension when applied once daily. The exact mechanism behind the increase in iris pigmentation and the clinical significance of this previously unknown side-effect needs to be investigated further.

Patients (n = 223) having an IOP of above 22 mmHg were recruited from 16 eye specialist centres in Scandinavia and Finland. The patients were randomized to two treatment groups, timolol solution treatment and timolol in gel-forming solution treatment. Eyes with and without pseudoexfoliation were included. The patients were stratified regarding the presence or not of pseudoexfoliation, to ensure appropriate distribution of this condition. No difference in intraocular pressure reducing effect was registered for the two groups. The pressure reducing effect of the two modes of treatment was not affected by the presence or not of pseudoexfoliation. The study also included registration of local and systemic signs and symptoms possibly related to the study medications. Blurring of vision occurred more often in patients given 0.5% timolol in gel-forming solution compared to timolol solution. The heart rate decreased statistically significantly in patients given timolol solution, but not in patients given timolol in gel-forming solution.

To further evaluate long-term safety and efficacy, once-daily bimatoprost 0.03% was compared with timolol 0.5% twice daily through year 4. METHODS: In this multicentre, double-masked, randomised, controlled trial, glaucoma and ocular hypertension patients (n = 152) who completed phase III bimatoprost trials through month 36 were enrolled in a study extension through month 48. Patients randomised to bimatoprost once daily (n = 78) or timolol twice daily (n = 35) continued on the same regimen for a fourth year. Patients randomised to bimatoprost twice daily had been switched to bimatoprost once daily dosing at month 24 (bimatoprost twice daily/once daily treatment group), and continued with once daily dosing through month 48 (n = 39). IOP was measured at 08:00 and 10:00 at months 39, 42, 45 and 48. Safety measures included adverse events, biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, visual acuity and visual field. RESULTS: Baseline IOP was comparable among groups. During year 4, mean IOP reductions from baseline were 7.0 to 8.1 mm Hg with bimatoprost once daily and 6.5 to 7.9 mm Hg with bimatoprost twice daily/once daily, significantly greater than with timolol twice daily (3.8 to 5.8 mm Hg, p< or =0.035) at all measurements. Over 4 years, the mean IOP reduction from baseline at 08:00 and 10:00 was 1.9 to 3.9 mm Hg (35% to 100%) greater with bimatoprost once daily than with timolol (p< or =0.013). Low IOPs were achieved by more bimatoprost than timolol patients (p< or =0.042). No safety concerns developed during long-term bimatoprost treatment; two patients in the timolol treatment group discontinued after month 36 because of adverse events. The most common treatment-related adverse event in the bimatoprost treatment groups was conjunctival hyperaemia. CONCLUSION: Bimatoprost once daily provided sustained IOP lowering greater than timolol twice daily and was well tolerated over long-term use."

Methods: In the Malmo Ocular Hypertension Study, 90 patients were randomized to topical timolol or placebo treatment and observed prospectively for up to 10 years. Patients with elevated intraocular pressure (1OP) and with open angles and normal visual fields, plus at least one extra risk factor, were eligible. Risk factors were suspect disc or known disc hemorrhage, positive family history of glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion syndrome, diabetes, and mean IOP on DTC [greater-than or equal to] 27 mm Hg. These risk factors and also the mean baseline IOP and IOP fluctuation, sex, age, and blood pressure were evaluated as predictors for development of reproducible glaucomatous visual field loss. In addition to the prospective data, post-study data were retrieved from patients' records extending maximum follow-up to 17 years. Results: Thirty-seven patients developed glaucomatous visual field loss. Of all factors included in the analysis, disc appearance, older age, and higher IOP came out as significant risks. Suspect disc appearance increased the risk approximately three times, with a hazard ratio of 2.90, and CI: 1.34-6.30, the hazard ratio was 1.05 and CI: 1.03-1.09 per year of age, while mean baseline IOP increased the risk with 14% per mm Hg (CI: 1.01-1.28). Conclusion: Patients with ocular hypertension were at higher risk for developing glaucomatous visual field loss if discs were suspect, if IOP was high, and if the patient was older in age.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized, open-label study with two parallel groups was conducted in five centers in Greece. The study enrolled 148 patients with inadequately controlled open-angle or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (intraocular pressure of at least 22 mm Hg) or ocular hypertension (intraocular pressure of at least 27 mm Hg) who were receiving monotherapy with a beta-blocker or dual therapy in which one of the agents was a beta-blocker. The patients were switched to timolol 0.5% twice daily for 2 to 4 weeks (run-in period) before the start of the study (baseline). At baseline, the patients were randomized to receive latanoprost 0.005% once daily or dorzolamide 2% twice daily as add-on therapy to timolol. The intraocular pressure was recorded at 9:30 AM, 12:30 PM, and 3:30 PM at baseline and at 3 months. Safety was followed throughout the study. RESULTS: The diurnal intraocular pressure reduction was significant in both groups (P < 0.001). The mean intraocular pressure reduction from baseline was 32% for the latanoprost plus timolol group and 20% for the dorzolamide plus timolol group. The least square estimate of the mean diurnal intraocular pressure reduction after 3 months was -7.06 mm Hg in the latanoprost plus timolol group and -4.44 mm Hg in the dorzolamide plus timolol group (P < 0.001). Drugs administered in both treatment groups were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: This study clearly showed that the additive diurnal intraocular pressure-lowering effect of latanoprost is superior to that of dorzolamide in patients treated with timolol."

This study investigates the safety and efficacy of 0.2% brimonidine administered twice daily for 1 year in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. METHODS: The study design was a multicenter, double-masked, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled comparison clinical trial. Subjects instilled 0.2% brimonidine or 0.5% timolol maleate twice daily for 12 months. Subjects were examined at baseline, week 1, and months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. A subset of subjects was examined at week 2. RESULTS: Of 443 subjects enrolled in this study, 374 met the entry criteria; 186 received brimonidine and 188 received timolol. Brimonidine-treated subjects showed an overall mean peak reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) of 6.5 mm Hg; timolol-treated subjects had a mean peak reduction in IOP of 6.1 mm Hg. Brimonidine lowered mean peak IOP significantly more than timolol at week 2 and month 3 (P < .03); no significant difference was observed between the groups for this variable at other visits throughout the 1-year course of the study. No evidence of tachyphylaxis was seen in either group. Allergy was seen in 9% of subjects treated with brimonidine. Dry mouth was more common in the brimonidine-treated group than in the timolol-treated group (33.0% vs 19.4%), but complaints of burning and stinging were more common in the timolol-treated group (41.9%) than in the brimonidine-treated patients (28.1%). Headache, fatigue, and drowsiness were similar in the 2 groups. In general, the tolerance to medication was acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Brimonidine is safe and effective in lowering IOP in glaucomatous eyes. Brimonidine provides a sustained long-term ocular hypotensive effect, is well tolerated, and has a low rate of allergic response.

Brinzolamide 1.0%, dosed two times (b.i.d.) and three times (t.i.d.) a day, dorzolamide 2.0% (t.i.d.), and placebo (t.i.d) were administered to patients during a 3-month treatment period. Diurnally corrected IOP reduction from baseline, including peak and trough times, was the primary end point. Sample sizes were chosen to establish statistical equivalence between treatments. Mean IOP changes observed on treatment were as follows: -3.4 mm Hg (-13.2%) to -4.1 mm Hg (-16.7%) with brinzolamide 1.0% b.i.d.; -4.1 mm Hg (-16.6%) to -4.8 mm Hg (-19.1%) with brinzolamide 1% t.i.d.; and -4.3 mm Hg (-16.9%) to -4.9 mm Hg (-20.1%) with dorzolamide 2.0%. IOP reductions after administration of brinzolamide 1.0% b.i.d. and t.i.d. were equivalent to each other and also clinically and statistically equivalent to those with dorzolamide 2.0% t.i.d. The incidence of ocular discomfort (burning and stinging) upon instillation was significantly higher for dorzolamide (10.7%) than brinzolamide (b.i.d. or t.i.d., 3.0% each). The most frequent non-ocular event reported was taste perversion, which was less (3.7%) with brinzolamide 1.0% b.i.d., but brinzolamide t.i.d. was similar to dorzolamide t.i.d. (6.8% vs. 5.3%). Brinzolamide 1.0% b.i.d., brinzolamide 1.0% t.i.d., and dorzolamide 2.0% t.i.d. equaled each other in IOP-lowering efficacy, and brinzolamide was significantly more comfortable than dorzolamide upon instillation."

Methods: The study was a double-masked, randomized, parallel group, multicenter, non-inferiority design. Adult patients with OAG or OHT and with qualifying IOP (24 to 36 mm Hg at 8 AM; 21 to 36 mm Hg at 10 AM and 4 PM following appropriate washout of previous ocular hypotensives) in at least one eye on two eligibility visits received either travoprost 0.004% preserved with BAC (n = 346) or travoprost BAC-free (n = 344) dosed once-daily each evening. Study patients were followed for a period of 3 months. IOP measurements at 8 AM, 10 AM and 4 PM were taken at study visits on week 2, week 6, and month 3. Results: The 95% confidence limits for the difference in mean IOP were within +/- 0.8 mmHg at 9 of 9 study visits and times in both the per protocol and intent-to-treat data sets. Mean IOP reductions, across all 9 study visits and times in both the per protocol and intent-to-treat data sets, ranged from 7.3 to 8.5 mmHg for travoprost BAC-free and from 7.4 to 8.4 mmHg for travoprost 0.004%. Statistical equivalence was also demonstrated for the comparison of mean IOP changes; 95% confidence limits are within +/- 0.8 mmHg at 9 of 9 study visits and times in both the per protocol and intent-to-treat data sets. Adverse events and the number of patients discontinued due to adverse events were similar for both treatment groups. 6.4% of patients treated with travoprost BAC-free experienced an adverse event due to hyperemia. Conclusions: Travoprost BAC-free is equivalent to travoprost 0.004% in both safety and efficacy."

DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. METHODS: In a prospective, 8-week, investigator-masked, parallel-group study conducted at numerous centers in the United States, 165 previously treated patients with IOP >or= 25 mm Hg in one or both eyes after washout were randomly assigned to receive either latanoprost 0.005% once daily in the evening or unoprostone 0.15% twice daily. Observations procedures were Goldmann applanation tonometry, best-corrected visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, and ophthalmoscopy. The main outcome measure was change in the mean of the IOPs measured at 8:00 AM, 12 noon, and 4:00 PM between baseline (before treatment) and after 8 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: The change in the mean +/- SD of the IOPs measured at 8:00 AM, 12 noon, and 4:00 PM was -7.2 +/- 3.2 mm Hg (28%) for latanoprost (25.3 +/- 2.8 mm Hg at baseline to 18.2 +/- 2.8 mm Hg at 8 weeks) and -3.9 +/- 2.6 mm Hg (15%) for unoprostone (25.5 +/- 3.3 mm Hg at baseline to 21.6 +/- 4.0 mm Hg; P <or=.001.

Method: Randomised (1 UI: 1 DH: 1 BT), double-masked, active-controlled study in which 146 patients received TM b.i.d. for a 2-week run-in period, prior to adjunctive therapy with either UI, DH, or BT b.i.d. for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in 8-hour diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) at Week 12. Safety was assessed by comprehensive ophthalmic examination, vital signs, and spontaneously reported adverse events. Results: A statistically (P<0.001) and clinically significant additional reduction over the timolol baseline in 8-hour diurnal IOP (mean &plusmn; SD) was observed in all treatment groups: -2.7 &plusmn; 1.9 mm Hg with UI, -3.1 &plusmn; 2.5 mm Hg with DH, and -2.8 &plusmn; 2.4 mm Hg with BT.

The IOP-lowering effects of Lat and Dor+Tim were not statistically different based on the 95% confidence interval (-1.1, 0.4 mmHg) for the difference in mean diurnal IOP reduction between groups. The percentage of patients achieving diurnal IOP reduction =20% was higher in the Lat group (52%) compared to the Dor+Tim group (43%). Mean IOP reductions at 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. were statistically significant (p<0.001) in both the Lat (-4.1 mmHg, -4.6 mmHg) and Dor+Tim groups (-4.2 mmHg, -3.8 mmHg). At 10 a.m. the two treatments had a comparable IOP-lowering effect, while at 5 p.m. Lat showed a significantly higher effect in reducing IOP (p=0.0454). Both medications were well-tolerated.

METHODS: A randomized cross-over masked study was performed. We enrolled one eye of each of 28 patients who were on different beta-blocker therapy. We measured the intraocular pressure (IOP) 2 h after the beta-blocker instillation; we then randomly administered one of the two drugs and we compiled an IOP diurnal curve. One month later we repeated the same procedures with the second drug. Unpaired Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare decreases in IOP between the two drugs (P<0.05). RESULTS: Both brimonidine 0.2% and dorzolamide 2% have good ocular hypotensive efficacy, significantly lowering IOP when compared to beta-blocker therapy alone, for the whole diurnal curve. Maximum mean percent IOP decrease from baseline was 22.0+/-15.7% (4.0+/-2.9 mmHg) for dorzolamide 2% 6 h after instillation and 35.5+/-16.4% (7.0+/-4.1 mmHg) for brimonidine 0.2% 8 h after administration of the drug. When we compared the two treatments, brimonidine 0.2% showed a higher hypotensive effect than 2% dorzolamide after 4 h (28.4+/-16.8% vs 17.6 +/-9.3%; P=0.04) and 8 h (35.5+/-16.4% vs 21.6 +/-10.8%; P=0.04).

"Purpose: This 9-month study compared the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy and safety of once-daily travoprost ophthalmic solutions (0.0015% and 0.004%) with twice-daily timolol 0.5%. Patients and Methods: This study was conducted using a double-masked, randomized, parallel-group design; adult patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension (IOP between 24 and 36 mm Hg, inclusive at 9 AM and between 21 and 36 mm Hg, inclusive, at 11 AM and 4 PM on two eligibility visits after an appropriate washout of previous treatments). In both eyes, the travoprost vehicle (placebo) was instilled at 9 AM and travoprost (0.0015% or 0.004%) was instilled at 9 Pm, or timolol 0.5% was instilled at both times. The primary efficacy variable was mean IOP measured at 9 AM, 11 AM, and 4 PM at baseline and follow-up visits. Results: Five hundred seventy-three patients were randomized to the study treatments. Mean IOP, which was combined across study visits, was lower with travoprost 0.004% than with timolol 0.5% at 9 AM (P = 0.0246), 11 AM (P = 0.0039), and 4 PM (P = 0.0004). Intraocular pressure was lower with travoprost 0.004% than with travoprost 0.0015% at 11 AM (P = 0.0314), the time of peak drug activity. Mean IOP was consistently lower with travoprost 0.0015% than with timolol 0.5%. Mean IOP reductions from baseline were significantly (P [less-than or equal to] 0.0001) greater with travoprost 0.004% (8.0-8.9 mm Hg) than with timolol 0.5% (6.3-7.9 mm Hg). The most frequent related adverse events were hyperemia, pruritus, discomfort, pain, and iris pigmentation changes. The local tolerance was better in the timolol group compared with patients receiving travoprost. There were no serious unexpected treatment-related adverse events in any group. Conclusions: Travoprost 0.004% reduced diurnal mean intraocular pressure significantly more than timolol 0.5%.

Evaluation was made by comparing with timolol ophthalmic solution in a double-masked study at 16 hospitals. Results obtained are as follows. 1) The total of 139 patients (71 patients in betaxolol group and 68 patients in timolol group) participated in the study. Among them, 2 patients (1 patient in each group) were excluded from the analysis for efficacy and utility. No significant difference was observed in the background other than the treatment history of beta-blocker ophthalmic solution between two groups of 137 patients. 2) The analysis were conducted in Cohort I (all patients) and Cohort II (single therapy patients). 3) Evaluation by Investigators (1) The analysis of Final Global Improvement Rating (FGIR) by U and .CHI.2 test showed no significant difference between two groups in both Cohort I and Cohort II. (2) The analysis of Overall Safety Rating (OSR) by U-test demonstrated timolol group was significantly superior to betaxolol group (p<0.05). The analysis of side effect by .CHI.2 test exhibited that timolol group was significantly superior to betaxolol group in Cohort I (P<0.05), but there was no significant difference between the two groups in Cohort II. (3) The analysis of Global Utility Rating (GUR) by U-test showed timolol group was significantly superior to betaxolol group in Cohort I (P<0.05), but there was no significant difference between the two groups in Cohort II. (4) The reasons that betaxolol group was inferior to timolol group in OSR and GUR were due to temporary ""stinging"" and ""ocular pain"" at the time of instillation. 4) Evaluation by Central Committee (1) The analysis of FGIR by U-test observed timolol group was superior to betaxolol group in Cohort I (P<0.01), but there was no significant difference between the two groups in Cohort II. The improvement rate (at least ""Improved"") was 69% and 80% for betaxolol group in Cohort I and Cohort II, respectively , and 82% and 85% for timolol group in Cohort I and Cohort II with no significant difference between two groups. (2) The analysis of OSR was conducted in two ways. OSR I was equal to OSR of investigators. OSR II was evaluated based on ocular signs and systemic side effects. No significant difference between the two groups in both Cohort I and Cohort II was demonstrated in the analysis of OSR II by U and .CHI.2 test. (3) There was no significant difference in GUR between the two groups. 5) Significant decrease in pulse rate after instillation was shown in timolol group (P<0.01). 6) Side effects in betaxolol group were mainly temporary ""stinging"" and ""ocular pain"" at the time of instillation. In timolol group, systemic side effects, bradycardia, depression, headache and dizziness were observed. Based on the above results, betaxolol ophthalmic solution has been shown to be clinically effective and useful in controlling intraocular pressure in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension and has a lower potential for producing systemic side effects when compared to timolol.

Approximately 81% of the patients in the once-daily treatment group and 88% of subjects in the twice-daily treatment group successfully completed the 3-month study period. The overall mean decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) was 4.5 mmHg in the once-daily group and 5.6 mmHg in the twice-daily group. These differences were not statistically different. For both treatment groups, effects on mean heart rate and blood pressure were minimal. The authors' data from this population suggest that once-daily treatment with levobunolol is an effective glaucoma regimen. CAS Registry/EC Number/Name of Substance 47141-42-4 (Levobunolol)."

After the washout of previous ocular hypotensive drugs, patients with IOP > or = 23 mm Hg in at least one eye at 10 AM or 4 PM on study day 1 were randomly allocated to receive one of the study treatments. Throughout the study, IOP was measured 2 and 8 hours after instillation of study medication for the morning peak effect (hour 2) and afternoon trough effect (hour 8). After 12 weeks of therapy, the mean change in IOP was not significantly different between the dorzolamide and betaxolol treatment groups at hour 8 (-3.6 mm Hg in both groups) or hour 2 (-5.4 vs -5.3 mm Hg, respectively). The differences between treatments (and 95% CIs associated with these differences) in mean IOP changes from baseline were 0.02 mm Hg (-0.870 to 0.901) for hour 8 and -0.14 mm Hg (-0.959 to 0.685) for hour 2. The ocular adverse experience (AE) most frequently reported by patients was ocular burning and/or stinging, and the most frequently reported nonocular AEs were taste perversion, upper respiratory infection, and headache. Only the incidence of taste perversion was significantly different between treatment groups (14.6% for the dorzolamide group and 0.0% for the betaxolol group). Two percent of patients in each treatment group discontinued the study due to AEs. This study confirmed the similar IOP-lowering effect of 2% dorzolamide and 0.5% betaxolol.

Methods: This was a six month, prospective, multicenter, double-masked study. Patients were placed on timolol (b.i.d.) for a 3-week run-in phase and then randomly assigned to travoprost 0.0015% (q.d.) plus timolol (b.i.d.), travoprost 0.004% (q.d.) plus timolol (b.i.d.) or vehicle (q.d.) plus timolol (b.i.d.). Travoprost was dosed in the evening. Mean IOP at 8 AM, 10 AM and 4 PM in the patient's worse eye was the primary efficacy variable. Results: Significant additional reductions in IOP were observed when travoprost was used adjunctively with timolol. Mean baseline values (mmHg) for patients at eligibility (while maintained on timolol) were 25.0 (travoprost 0.0015%), 25.0 (travoprost 0.004%) and 25.2 (vehicle). IOP reductions were greatest in the travoprost 0.004% group with mean changes ranging from -5.7 to -7.2 mmHg (23.1 to 27.7%) compared to travoprost 0.0015% (-5.1 to -6.7 mmHg, 20.8 to 25.9%) and vehicle (-1.3 to -2.8 mmHg, 5.4 to 10.9%). Mean IOP at 4 PM (near trough for both drugs) was 18.7 mmHg for 0.0015%, 18.5 mmHg for 0.004% and 22.8 mmHg for vehicle. Ocular hyperemia was trace to mild for all treatment groups. No iris pigmentation changes were observed for any patient during this study. There were no significant differences in change from baseline in visual acuity, ocular cells and flare, ocular signs, fundus parameter, cup/disc ratio and visual field between any of the treatment groups and there were no serious, unexpected, treatment-related, adverse events reported for any treatment group. Conclusions: Travoprost (0.0015% and 0.004%) produced clinically relevant and statistically significant additional IOP reductions from baseline when used adjunctively with timolol in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

The results showed that the hypotensive effects were highly significant and equal for both treatments. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the amount of cupping of the nerve head or the visual field defects developing during treatment. An additive hypotensive effect was recorded when both propranolol and timolol were combined with pilocarpine, which indicates the development of tolerance to both beta-blockers. Pulse rate and blood pressure were moderately reduced in both groups, both significantly more so in the propranolol group. The investigation indicates that when combined with pilocarpine the 2 adrenergic beta-receptor blockers are equally effective. We believe that oral propranolol can improve drug compliance in the treatment of glaucoma.

METHODS. Randomized, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group study involving 371 patients with inadequate IOP control (IOP from 22 to 34 mmHg) after [greater-than or equal to]3 weeks of run-in on any monotherapy. Patients were treated with fixed-combination brimonidine/timolol BID (fixed-combination group, n=188) or concomitant brimonidine BID and timolol BID (concomitant group, n=183). IOP was assessed pre-dose and 2 hours after morning dosing at weeks 2, 6, and 12. RESULTS. A total of 355 patients (96%) completed the study. Patient demographics, run-in monotherapy, and baseline mean IOP on monotherapy were comparable between treatment groups. During follow-up, the mean reduction from baseline IOP was significant (p<0.001) at all time points and ranged from 4.4 to 5.3 mmHg in each group. Brimonidine/timolol fixed combination was as effective as concomitant therapy with respect to mean IOP and mean change from baseline IOP at all time points and visits. Between-group differences were [less-than or equal to]0.35 mmHg for mean IOP and [less-than or equal to]0.30 mmHg for mean change from baseline IOP; none were significant. No unexpected side effects were associated with the fixed combination. Both treatments were well tolerated with no difference in adverse events between groups. CONCLUSIONS. Brimonidine/timolol fixed-combination therapy is as safe and effective as concomitant treatment with the individual components.

This active-controlled, double-masked, randomized, multicenter, 12-week study compared the effectiveness and tolerability of dorzolamide hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 2% TID with those of pilocarpine hydrochloride 2% QID as adjunctive therapy to timolol maleate ophthalmic gel-forming solution (TG) 0.5% QD as measured by changes in IOP and occurrence of adverse events. One hundred ninety-four patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension participated in this study. Their mean age was approximately 63 years. Slightly more than one half were white, and approximately one third were black. After a 3-week run-in period during which all patients received TG 0.5% QD, patients with an IOP of > or = 22 mm Hg at the morning trough measurement were randomly assigned to receive additional double-masked therapy with either dorzolamide or pilocarpine. The primary outcome measure was the mean change in IOP at the morning trough measurement from baseline to week 12. The secondary outcome measure was the mean change in IOP at the morning peak measurement from baseline to week 12. There was no significant difference in IOP-lowering effect between the 2 drugs at either morning trough or morning peak. The mean change in IOP at morning trough was -3.17 mm Hg (-12%) in patients receiving dorzolamide; it was -3.45 mm Hg (-13%) in patients receiving pilocarpine. The mean change in IOP at morning peak was -2.25 mm Hg (-10%) for patients who received dorzolamide and -2.51 mm Hg (-11%) for those who received pilocarpine. In the pilocarpine group, 62 (63%) patients experienced > or =1 adverse event compared with 35 (36%) patients in the dorzolamide group (P < 0.001). Twenty-one (21%) patients in the pilocarpine group discontinued treatment because of an adverse event compared with 2 (2%) patients in the dorzolamide group (P < 0.001). These results demonstrate that dorzolamide and pilocarpine were equally effective as adjunctive therapy in lowering IOP but that dorzolamide was better tolerated.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of latanoprost with that of the fixed combination of dorzolamide and timolol over 8 weeks. METHODS: This interventional, 8-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study was conducted at 18 centers in 6 Latin American countries. Patients with unilateral or bilateral primary open-angle, pigmentary, or exfoliative glaucoma or OHT were randomized to receive latanoprost, 1 drop in the affected eye QD (evening), or fixed-combination dorzolamide/timolol, 1 drop in the affected eye BID (morning and evening). Medications were self-administered, 1 drop per affected eye. At baseline and week 8, intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured 3 times each at 8:30 am, 10:00 am, 2:00 pm, and 5:00 pm and after the water-drinking test, which estimates the IOP peak of diurnal tension curve, performed following the 5:00 pm IOP assessment. The primary efficacy outcome was change in diurnal IOP (the mean of IOP measurements) from baseline to week 8. Adverse effect (AE) data were recorded at each visit. RESULTS: A total of 229 patients were randomized (latanoprost, n = 112; dorzolamide/timolol, n = 117). Mean baseline diurnal IOP values were similar between the 2 groups. Mean (SD) diurnal IOP reductions at week 8 before the water-drinking test were 6.9 (3.0) mm Hg for the latanoprost group and 6.4 (3.2) mm Hg for the dorzolamide/timolol group. Mean IOP values were similar at all time points except at 5:00 pm, when levels were significantly lower in latanoprost-treated patients (P = 0.025). After the water-drinking test, the increase in IOP values was similar between groups at baseline but lower in latanoprost-treated patients at week 8 (adjusted difference, 1.08 mm Hg; P = 0.012). Fewer patients treated with latanoprost reported ocular or systemic AEs (P = 0.025 and P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this study of patients with unilateral or bilateral primary open-angle, pigmentary, or exfoliative glaucoma or OHT IOP reductions generally were similar between treatment groups, except at 5:00 pm, when the mean IOP level was significantly lower in latanoprost-treated patients.

The difference between timolol and latanoprost given as monotherapies was 5.0 mmHg (p<0.001) in favor of latanoprost. Conclusion: Latanoprost caused a significant IOP-reducing effect, both when added to timolol and as monotherapy."

METHOD: Prospective, investigator masked, randomized study that included 38 patients (38 eyes) with primary open angle glaucoma uncontrolled under beta blockers. Each patient received latanoprost, travoprost and the fixed combination timolol-dorzolamide (for 3 months each). The first drug and the order of the next drugs administered were randomized. The follow up period was 9 months. At the baseline and at the end of each therapeutic period (3 months) we determined the IOP (at 8, 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.), visual acuity, C/D ratio, blood pressure, heart rate and local tolerance. We have also photographed the eyelids, lashes, conjunctiva and iris. After each month of treatment we determined the IOP (at 8 and 10 am), visual acuity, blood pressure, heart rate and local tolerance. RESULTS: The mean initial IOP was 25.1 2.89 mmHg and after 9 months of treatment 21.67 4.59 mmHg. Each drug induced a statistically significant IOP decrease (the fixed combination timolol-dorzolamide decreased IOP with 14.33%, travoprost with 18.39% and latanoprost with 22.1%). The IOP lowering was comparable for the prostaglandin derivatives and superior to the fixed combination timolol-dorzolamide. None of these drugs had a negative influence on the visual field, C/D ratio, visual acuity, blood pressure and heart rate. There was good local tolerance. The side effects were more frequent after travoprost (37) and latanoprost (22) than after the fixed combination timolol-dorzolamide (4 cases). The most important adverse events for the prostaglandin derivatives were conjunctival hyperemia, eyelashes pigmentation and growth, iris pigmentation. There was no necessary to stop the medication because of these effects. CONCLUSIONS: Travoprost, latanoprost and the fixed combination timolol-dorzolamide are efficient in the treatment of primary open angle glaucoma. The prostaglandin derivatives determined similar IOP decrease, which was superior to the fixed combination timolol-dorzolamide; the local tolerance was good, the fixed combination causing the fewest side effects.

Results of the betaxolol versus placebo treatment trial in ocular hypertension	Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology	 	2003	241	3	196	203	"Purpose: To determine whether treatment with betaxolol can delay or prevent the conversion from ocular hypertension to early glaucoma on the basis of visual field criteria, by means of a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Methods: Three hundred and fifty-six ocular hypertensives were randomized to treatment with either betaxolol drops or placebo drops during the period 1992-1996. Each patient was followed prospectively with 4-monthly visits. Examination at each visit included visual field testing, intra-ocular pressure (IOP) measurement and optic disc imaging. Conversion to early glaucoma was defined on the basis of visual field change by AGIS criteria. An intent-to-treat analysis compared visual field conversion after 3 years in the treatment and placebo arms. Normal visual field survival analysis was also performed. The IOP characteristics of the two treatment groups were compared. Results: Two hundred and fifty-five patients completed the study, which ended in 1998, with a range of follow-up of 2-6 years. Sixteen (13.2%) of 121 patients in the placebo group converted to glaucoma, compared with 12 (9.0%) of 134 patients in the betaxolol group. The intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated no evidence of any difference in conversion rates between the betaxolol and placebo groups after 3 years. Visual field survival analysis demonstrated no significant difference between the betaxolol and placebo groups. The betaxolol-treated group had significantly lower post-treatment IOP values. Converters had significantly higher pre- and post-treatment IOP values than non-converters. Conclusions: Betaxolol significantly lowered the IOP level compared with placebo. Conversion to glaucoma was found to be related to both the baseline and post-treatment IOP levels. However the intent-to-treat analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in the conversion rate in the betaxolol-treated group."

In the two studies presented in this report, we sought (a) to evaluate the absolute efficacy of carteolol (i.e., vs. its vehicle) over an extended period and (b) to evaluate the utility of carteolol versus that of timolol when used concomitantly with pilocarpine. Study 1 was a doublemasked, randomized, 6-week evaluation conducted in 64 patients of 1% carteolol HCl, 2% carteolol HCl, and its vehicle given twice daily in both eyes. From an unmedicated baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) of 23-25 mm Hg, mean reductions in the carteolol treatment groups ranged from 5.8 to 6.6 mm Hg (23-26% reduction). Mean reductions in heart rate were six to seven beats/ min, two beats/min, and one beat min in the 1% carteolol, 2% carteolol, and vehicle groups, respectively. Study 2 was a double-masked, randomized, 12-week evaluation of 1% carteolol HCl, 2% carteolol HCl, and 0.5% timolol in combination with pilocarpine, either 2% or 4%, in 67 patients. From an unmedicated baseline IOP of 24-29 mm Hg, mean reductions from this unmedicated baseline with combination beta-adrenoceptor antagonist/pilocarpine treatment ranged from 6 to 10 mm Hg in all groups (24-40%). Mean decreases in heart rate ranged from one to six beats/min, with no meaningful differences among the treatment groups. Based on the efficacy of twice-daily carteolol in reducing IOP by similar25%, as well as its efficacy when used concomitantly with pilocarpine, we suggest that clinicians may find carteolol a useful addition to their pharmacopeia in the treatment of elevated IOP.

Study 1 (n = 256) was conducted in the United States and Study 2 (n = 288) was conducted in Europe/Israel. Patients could be included whether or not they were currently taking ocular hypotensive therapy, and regardless of the effectiveness of any previous therapy. Patients were washed out from their usual ocular hypotensive medications and then those with a baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) [greater-than or equal to] 24 mmHg were randomized to either the dorzolamide/timolol combination eye drops twice daily or latanoprost eye drops once daily in both eyes. Efficacy was assessed by daytime diurnal IOP (the mean of measurements made at 0800, 1000, 1400 and 1600 h). Results: At baseline, the mean daytime diurnal IOP was 26.1 mmHg in the dorzolamide/timolol combination group versus 25.6 mmHg in the latanoprost group in Study 1, and 25.3 mmHg in the dorzolamide/timolol combination group versus 24.7 mmHg in the latanoprost group in Study 2. After 3 months, the mean daytime diurnal IOP was 18.9 mmHg for the dorzolamide/timolol combination versus 18.4 mmHg for latanoprost in Study 1, and 17.4 mmHg for the dorzolamide/timolol combination versus 17.5 mmHg for latanoprost in Study 2. The difference between treatments in mean IOP change at 3 months was -0.04 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.85, 0.77] in Study 1, and -0.57 mmHg (95% CI - 1.31, 0.16) in Study 2. The probability that the true difference lay between -1.5 and 1.5 mmHg, the predefined bounds for equivalance, was > 0.950 in both studies. Both treatments were well tolerated over 3 months, although ocular stinging occurred more frequently with the dorzolamide/timolol combination. Conclusion: The dorzolamide/timolol combination and latanoprost were equally effective at lowering IOP.

One hundred fifty-two patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive either timolol maleate gel-forming solution QD or levobunolol BID for 6 weeks, followed by a crossover to the alternate treatment. IOP and heart rate were measured at morning trough and peak during weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. Timolol maleate gel-forming solution QD was comparable to levobunolol BID in reducing IOP at peak and trough. Although the effects on peak heart rate were similar between the two medications, the effect on trough heart rate of timolol maleate gel-forming solution QD was significantly less than that of levobunolol BID (P = 0.001). The incidence of ocular burning and stinging was comparable between the two treatments.

The preservation of the ocular surface during chronic administration of hypotensive eye drops	Orbit	 	1997	 	 	87	90	"The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of multidose therapy of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) on tear fluid parameters. The effect of various preparations of preserved timolol 0.5% eye drops on lacrimal tear film stability (BUT), on basal lacrimal secretion (Jones test), on corneal epithelial cells (Rose bengal test) and on the symptomatology (foreign body sensation, photophobia, burning sensation) was evaluated. In this randomized controlled study, groups were formed according to the three different preparations of timolol used: 1) unpreserved, with hyaluronic acid as the vehicle, administered once daily, 2) unpreserved, with an aqueous solution as the vehicle, administered twice daily, and 3) preserved, with carbopol as the vehicle, administered twice daily. In both groups using unpreserved drags, a significant increase in BUT was observed. The Jones test showed no significant increase within 7 days of treatment. However, 30 days after treatment, a significant improvement was achieved in group i in comparison with the other groups. It was only in the groups treated with unpreserved solutions that a significant improvement of the epithelial cell status could be observed. We conclude that the side-effects of chronic administration of timolol on the ocular surface could be reduced by the use of unpreserved eye drops. Furthermore, the use of hyaluronic acid as the vehicle resulted in an increase in tear film stability, an improvement of the epithelial cell status and an increase in the basal lacrimal secretion.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the study protocol, the questions to be answered, and the baseline characteristics of the subjects. DESIGN: Multicenter randomized clinical trial with 2 groups: topical ocular hypotensive medication and close observation. SETTING: Subjects were enrolled and evaluated at 22 participating clinical centers. Visual fields and stereoscopic optic disc photographs were read in masked fashion. METHODS: We determined eligibility from a comprehensive eye examination, medical and ocular history, visual field testing, and stereoscopic optic disc photography. RESULTS: We describe the baseline characteristics of 1637 subjects randomized between February 28, 1994, and October 31, 1996. The mean age was 55 years; 56.9% of the subjects were women; and 25% were African American. The baseline intraocular pressure was 24.9 +/- 2.7 mm Hg (mean +/- SD). Systemic diseases and conditions reported by subjects included previous use of medication for ocular hypertension, 37%; systemic hypertension, 38%; cardiovascular disease, 6%; diabetes mellitus, 12%; and family history of glaucoma, 44%. The mean horizontal cup-disc ratio by contour estimated from stereophotography was 0.36 +/- 0.18. Qualifying Humphrey 30-2 visual fields had to be normal and reliable for entry into the study. Health-related quality of life (36-item short form health survey) scores in the OHTS sample were better than the age- and sex-matched population norms. African American subjects had larger baseline cup-disc ratios and higher reported rates of elevated blood pressure and diabetes than the rest of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The intraocular pressure among enrolled subjects was sufficiently high to provide an adequate test of the potential benefit of ocular hypotensive medication in preventing or delaying glaucomatous damage. The large number of African American subjects enrolled should provide a good estimate of the African American response to topical medication.

METHODS: Patients with primary open-angle glaucoma were randomized by Latin square technique to one of the three treatment sequences in this crossover, prospective double-masked trial. Each treatment period consisted of 6 weeks of chronic dosing followed by a diurnal curve for the intraocular pressure measured at 08:00, 10:00, 16:00, 18:00, 20:00, 22:00, and 24:00 hours. Intraocular pressure was measured by applanation tonometry. RESULTS: Thirty patients completed this trial. The average diurnal intraocular pressures in the trial were measured for timolol maleate (17.7 +/- 2.7 mm Hg), brimonidine given three times daily (18.0 +/- 2.2 mm Hg), and brimonidine given twice daily (19.2 +/- 2.4 mm Hg). There was a statistical difference between groups (P <.005). When groups were compared by pairs, three times daily dosing with brimonidine and timolol maleate both reduced the pressure more than twice daily brimonidine at every time point past 10:00 hours and for the diurnal curve (P <.05). In contrast, three times daily brimonidine and timolol maleate were statistically similar for the diurnal pressure, and each time point, except timolol maleate, decreased the pressure more at 16:00 (P =.042). Safety was similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that both timolol maleate twice daily and brimonidine three times daily provide a similar intraocular pressure reduction to each other. Timolol maleate twice daily and brimonidine three times daily provide a greater decrease in pressure in the late afternoon and nighttime hours, compared with brimonidine twice daily.

METHODS: This was a one-year, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled, parallel-group trial of Brinz/Tim and Dorz/Tim. IOP assessments were taken at 8 and 10 AM at week 2 and months 3 and 9, and at 8 AM, 10 AM, and 4 PM at months 6 and 12. Primary efficacy was a noninferiority comparison of mean IOP at the three month 6 time points. RESULTS: Of the 437 patients enrolled, 220 dosed Brinz/Tim whereas 217 dosed Dorz/Tim twice daily. Brinz/Tim produced IOP-lowering efficacy comparable to Dorz/Tim, with the upper 95% confidence limits for the differences between groups within +1.5 mm Hg at all assessment times, including the month 6 primary efficacy time points, establishing noninferiority. Differences in means numerically favored Brinz/Tim at 9 of 12 study visits and times. The IOP reductions ranged from 7.2 to 9.2 mm Hg for Brinz/Tim and from 7.4 to 8.9 mm Hg for Dorz/Tim. Although a similar overall safety profile was observed between the 2 treatment groups, Brinz/Tim showed significantly less ocular irritation (2.7% vs. 10.6%; P=0.0009) than Dorz/Tim.

Methods: Fifty eyes of 50 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma were enrolled in the study. They had been receiving 0.5% timolol, 0.005% latanoprost and 1% dorzolamide for 3 months or longer. They were randomly divided into two groups of 25 eyes each. One group received unoprostone adjunctively. The other group continued the medication without unoprostone and served as control. Results: Baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) averaged 19.4+/-2.5 mmHg in unoprostone group and 19.6+/-2.4 mmHg in control group. There was no significant difference between, the two values. Eight weeks after start of unoprostone, the IOP averaged 19.1+/-1.9 mmHg in unoprostone group and 19.6+/-2.4 mmHg in control group. There was no significant difference in IOP between both groups up to 8 weeks. In 17 eyes with baseline IOP of 22 mmHg or over, the IOP decreased 8 weeks later by 1.3+/-1.0 mmHg in 8 eyes receiving unoprostone and by 0.1+/-1.0 mmHg in 9 control eyes. The difference was significant (p=0.0324). There was no difference in IOP in 33 eyes with baseline IOP of 21 mmHg or less. Conclusion: Addition of unoprostone did not induce further ocular hypotension when seen as a whole.

A randomized double-masked crossover study comparing latanoprost 0.005% (xalatan) with unoprostone 0.12% (rescula) in patients with primary open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension	Iovs	 	2000	 	 	ARVO Abstract 1484	 	"Purpose: To compare the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect of latanoprost 0.005% once daily with unoprostone 0.12% twice daily. Methods: Sixty patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT) were randomized to receive either latanoprost once daily in the evening (8 pm) and placebo once daily in the morning (8 am), or unoprostone twice daily in the morning (8 am) and evening (8 pm). The study was double-masked and followed a crossover design with two treatment periods of 1 month separated by a 3 week washout period. The IOP was measured at 9 am and 5 pm on the baseline and Day 28 visits, and at 9 am on Day 2 and Day 14 visits of each treatment period. The mean of the measurements was calculated. Safety parameters were also recorded. Results: Fifty-six patients completed both treatment periods and had IOP data available for evaluation. After 1 month of treatment, latanoprost significantly reduced IOP (mean &plusmn; SEM) by 5.9&plusmn;0.3 mmHg (p<0.001) and unoprostone by 3.9&plusmn;0.3 mmHg (p<0.001) from an overall adjusted baseline of 22.5 mmHg and 22.8 mmHg, respectively. The difference of 2.0 mmHg between treatments was statistically significant in favor of latanoprost (p<0.001, ANCOVA). Ocular symptoms and findings were equally distributed between treatment groups. Hyperemia and ocular irritation were the most frequently reported events. Conclusions: Latanoprost once daily was significantly more effective in reducing IOP compared with unoprostone twice daily after 1 month of treatment in patients with POAG and OHT.

A 3-month comparison of efficacy and safety of brimonidine-Purite 0.15% and Brimonidine 0.2% in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension	Journal of Ocular Pharmacology and Therapeutics	 	2003	19	1	37	44	"Purpose: To compare the efficacy and safety of brimonidine Purite 0.15% (ALPHAGAN P) BID with brimonidine 0.2% (ALPHAGAN) BID in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Methods: 3-month, multicenter, randomized, double-masked trial. Eligible patients were taking brimonidine 0.2% BID for at least 6 weeks prior to study entry and their intraocular pressure (IOP) was [less-than or equal to] 21 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either brimonidine Purite 0.15% BID (n = 203) or brimonidine 0.2% BID (n = 204). Scheduled visits were prestudy, baseline, and weeks 2, 6 and 12. IOP was measured at hour 0 and hour 2 to evaluate efficacy. Safety was measured by monitoring adverse events. Patient satisfaction and comfort were also evaluated at all visits. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the brimonidine 0.2% and brimonidine Purite 0.15% groups with respect to mean IOP at baseline. The IOP-lowering efficacy of brimonidine Purite 0.15% was equivalent to that of brimonidine 0.2% and both study treatments maintained IOP-lowering effects of brimonidine 0.2%. There were no significant between-group differences in mean IOP. The differences in the mean IOPs were [less-than or equal to] 0.26 mm Hg and the mean change from baseline IOP was [less-than or equal to] 0.35 mm Hg at all follow-up time points. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the overall incidence of adverse events. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were conjunctival hyperemia and allergic conjunctivitis: both were mild in severity. Conclusion: Brimonidine Purite 0.15% dosed BID provides equal IOP-lowering efficacy to brimonidine 0.2% BID. Patients previously controlled on brimonidine 0.2% can be successfully switched to brimonidine Purite 0.15%."

A 12-week study.[See comment]	Archives of Ophthalmology	Arch.Ophthalmol.	1996	114	8	929	932	"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the intraocular pressure (IOP)-reducing effect and the side effects of latanoprost (PhXA41), a new phenyl-substituted prostaglandin F2 alpha-isopropyl ester analogue, in patients with elevated IOP, using timolol maleate as the reference drug. METHODS: A total of 184 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension at 35 medical centers participated in this randomized double-masked study. The patients were randomized to receive either 0.005% latanoprost once daily or 0.5% timolol maleate twice daily, for a period of 12 weeks. Intraocular pressure was measured 24 hours after the administration of timolol, at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Latanoprost reduced IOP at the end of 12 weeks by 6.2 +/- 2.7 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) (26.8%), while timolol reduced IOP by 4.4 +/- 2.3 mm Hg (19.9%). At all visits latanoprost reduced IOP significantly more than timolol did. The main ocular side effects observed in both groups were conjunctival hyperemia and smarting. The main systemic side effect was a reduced pulse rate, which occurred in patients treated with timolol. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated that 0.005% latanoprost taken once daily is well tolerated and more effective in reducing IOP than 0.5% timolol taken twice daily. Thus, latanoprost may become an important choice for the medical treatment of glaucoma.

"Purpose: This study aimed to compare the safety and effect on intraocular pressure (IOP) of latanoprost given every evening versus pilocarpine/timolol maleate fixed combination (PTFC) given twice daily in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OH). Methods: Following a 6-week, medicine-free period, qualified patients were randomized for Period 1 to either placebo administered every morning and latanoprost every evening or to PTFC administered twice daily. After 8 weeks of treatment, IOP was measured at 08.00, 10.00, 16.00 and 18.00 hours. Patients were then switched to the opposite treatment and underwent a second diurnal evaluation at the end of Period 2. Results: Thirty-two patients completed this study. They demonstrated diurnal baseline IOP of 24.1 +/- 2.4 mmHg. Mean diurnal pressure was 16.8 +/- 2.1 mmHg on PTFC and 16.9 +/- 2.5 mmHg on latanoprost (p = 0.60). No statistical difference between treatments was observed at any individual time-point except at 10.00 hours, when the PTFC group demonstrated an IOP of 15.9 +/- 2.3 mmHg and latanoprost 16.8 +/- 2.7 mmHg (p = 0.02). There were no statistical differences between groups in unsolicited systemic or ocular adverse events (p > 0.05). However, the PTFC group showed a narrower pupil diameter (2.3 mm) than the latanoprost group (3.7 mm). Additionally, a solicited symptom survey demonstrated mild blurred vision, stinging and ocular pain with PTFC (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Both PTFC and latanoprost are efficacious in reducing diurnal IOP in POAG or OH. However, PTFC may be more effective in the late morning and may have a greater incidence of mild ocular side-effects. copyright 2008 The Authors.

DESIGN: Randomized, multicenter, observer-masked, parallel-group study. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred ninety-three patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma participated. INTERVENTION: After an open-label 3-week 0.5% timolol run-in period, patients with an hour 2 intraocular pressure (IOP) of > or = 22 mmHg were randomly assigned to receive either the dorzolamide/timolol combination twice daily or the concomitant use of brimonidine twice daily and timolol twice daily (brimonidine + timolol) for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The IOP-lowering effects at hour 0 and hour 2 were collected at 1, 3, and 6 months. We hypothesized that both treatment regimens would have comparable hour 2 IOP-lowering effects at month 3. The treatments were considered comparable if the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the treatment difference was within +/- 1.5 mmHg. Tolerability data were also collected at 1, 3, and 6 months. RESULTS: The primary efficacy analysis was based on the modified intent-to-treat population. At month 3, hour 2, the dorzolamide/timolol group had an adjusted mean (standard error) change in IOP of -5.04 (0.30) mmHg versus -5.41 (0.30) mmHg in the brimonidine + timolol group, with a treatment difference of 0.36 (0.40) mmHg (95% confidence interval [CI] of -0.42-1.14 mmHg). At month 3, hour 0, the dorzolamide/timolol group had a change in IOP of -3.66 (0.29) mmHg versus -4.15 (0.28) mmHg in the brimonidine + timolol group, with a treatment difference of 0.49 (0.39) mmHg (95% CI of -0.27-1.25 mmHg). Likewise, at all other observed time points, the 95% confidence interval of the treatment difference was within +/- 1.5 mmHg. Ninety-three patients (64%) in the dorzolamide/timolol group and 88 patients (60%) in the brimonidine + timolol group had adverse experiences that were deemed drug related by the investigator, for which 7 patients (5%) in the dorzolamide/timolol group and 8 patients (5%) in the brimonidine + timolol group were discontinued from the study. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of the dorzolamide/timolol combination and the concomitant administration of brimonidine and timolol were comparable. The incidence of drug-related adverse experiences and the incidence of discontinuations caused by drug-related adverse experiences were similar between groups.

This study evaluates the baseline visual field test characteristics (visual field status, reliability properties, etc.) of patients who underwent eligibility visual field testing for entry to the OHTS. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of baseline data as part of a longitudinal randomized clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand eight hundred nineteen ocular hypertensive individuals, aged 40 to 80 (mean age, 55). METHODS: Subjects underwent at least two Humphrey Field Analyzer Program 30-2 Full Threshold visual field examinations in both eyes for study eligibility. A third examination was performed if a prior test was abnormal, questionable, or unreliable. For final eligibility, two sets of visual field examinations had to meet OHTS criteria for reliability and had to be classified as ""normal."" All OHTS visual field tests of potential subjects were submitted for eligibility assessment to the OHTS Visual Field Reading Center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The percentage of visual fields that were normal and reliable according to OHTS criteria. RESULTS: Of the subset of 2304 subjects who completed the eligibility assessments, 1828 (79%) were OHTS-eligible based on visual field test requirements. A third eligibility test was required for 11% of all eyes because of unreliable, questionable, or abnormal test results. With the 33% fixation loss cutoff in the OHTS, 97% of all eligibility visual field examinations were reliable and 3% were unreliable. The most frequent cause (69.5%) of unreliability was excessive fixation losses. CONCLUSIONS: Permitting one repeat test after an abnormal or unreliable test allowed an extra 560 patients to be ""eligible"" for the study based on visual field tests. A clinical screening review of otherwise normal and reliable tests was not restrictive. The adoption of a 33% fixation loss cutoff significantly reduced the number of required retests and prevented study rejection of 89 patients."

METHODS: This was an institutional, randomized clinical trial. After a 24-hour assessment without treatment, 27 previously untreated patients with POAG were randomized to 6 weeks' treatment with twice-daily TDFC (8 AM and 8 PM) followed by once-daily latanoprost 0.005% (8 PM), or vice versa. One eye was analyzed per patient. The mean values of IOP, DBP, SBP, and DOPP (difference between DBP and IOP) were recorded at each time point, and the 24-hour data are the mean values of each patient's measurements over the 24-hour period. The differences between the values of the first treatment period and the baseline and the second treatment period and washout were calculated and analyzed by means of an analysis of variance model that tested the effects of sequence and treatment. RESULTS: Both treatments significantly reduced 24-hour IOP (P < 0.0001), but TDFC led to lower 24-hour pressure (mean +/- SD: 15.4 +/- 1.9 vs. 16.7 +/- 1.7 mm Hg; P = 0.004). Latanoprost did not lead to any significant reduction in mean 24-hour SBP and DBP (SBP: P = 0.952; DBP: P = 0.831), but TDFC did (SBP and DBP: P < 0.0001). Both treatments significantly increased 24-hour DOPP (P < 0.0001), with no difference between the two medications (P = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: In previously untreated patients with POAG, TDFC, and latanoprost equally enhanced 24-hour DOPP: the former by counteracting the decrease in DBP with a substantial reduction in IOP and the latter by not affecting DBP and significantly reducing IOP.

DESIGN: Prospective, open-label, and crossover clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension (ages, 44-79 years) who were receiving treatment with 0.005% latanoprost once every evening. METHODS: Baseline data of 24-hour IOP were collected in a sleep laboratory while patients were receiving latanoprost monotherapy. Measurements were taken every 2 hours in the sitting and supine positions during the 16-hour diurnal/wake period and in a supine position during the 8-hour nocturnal/sleep period. Patients were randomly assigned to receive an add-on treatment with either 1% brinzolamide 3 times per day or 0.5% timolol gel forming solution once every morning for 8 weeks, and then crossed over to receive the other add-on treatment. At the end of each add-on treatment period, 24-hour IOP data were collected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diurnal and nocturnal IOP means were compared among the baseline, the brinzolamide add-on treatment, and the timolol add-on treatment. RESULTS: During the diurnal period, the mean IOP under brinzolamide or timolol add-on treatment was significantly lower than the baseline IOP in both the sitting and supine positions. There was no statistical difference between the 2 add-on treatments. During the nocturnal period, the supine IOP under brinzolamide add-on treatment was significantly lower than both the baseline and the timolol add-on treatment. There was no difference in nocturnal IOP between the timolol add-on treatment and the baseline. CONCLUSIONS: In patients already receiving the latanoprost monotherapy, adding brinzolamide or timolol significantly reduced IOP during the diurnal period. However, only the brinzolamide add-on treatment had an IOP-lowering efficacy during the nocturnal period."

IOP was measured at baseline and 2 hours after morning instillation at weeks 2, 4, and 12. The primary outcome measure was the mean IOP reduction from baseline. Secondary measures were the percentage of patients in each group who achieved specific low target pressures and the incidence of adverse events. Mean IOP at baseline was 24.8 mm Hg in each group. At follow-up visits, mean reductions from baseline ranged from 8.5 to 9.0 mm Hg with brimP/bim and from 7.5 to 7.7 mm Hg with tim/latan. More patients achieved low target pressures with brimP/bim. At week 12, 69.2% of brimP/bim patients and 27.3% of tim/latan patients had IOPs of 16 mm Hg or lower (P = .024). Both regimens were well tolerated, and adverse events were infrequent. The combination of brimonidine Purite and bimatoprost was well tolerated and at least as effective as Timoptic-XE and latanoprost in reducing IOP.

This study was conducted to evaluate the central nervous system (CNS) and plasma lipid profiles associated with timolol maleate and carteolol hydrochloride in postmenopausal black women with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension. METHODS: One hundred subjects met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this randomized, double-masked, multicenter, parallel-group study. After completion of informed consent and complete ophthalmic examination, eligible patients entered a washout period, during which no topical ophthalmic medications were used. Blood samples were obtained for hematology and blood chemistry evaluations. Vital signs, ocular symptoms, Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R) evaluation, intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, and slit-lamp examinations were performed before randomization to treatment with either topical carteolol hydrochloride 1.0% or topical timolol maleate 0.5%. Patients received active medications twice daily and were monitored at 4 weeks and 12 weeks. At the conclusion of treatment, vital signs, ocular symptoms, SCL-90-R evaluation, IOP, slit-lamp examinations, and blood samples were obtained. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was significantly decreased (worsened) in the timolol group but did not change significantly in the carteolol group. The between-group difference was statistically significant. Total cholesterol to HDL ratio significantly increased (worsened) in the timolol group compared with baseline but did not change in the carteolol group. The difference between groups was statistically significant. No significant differences were observed between groups in SCL-90-R results for either somatization or depression. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that topical carteolol hydrochloride may have a more favorable blood lipid profile than topical timolol maleate in postmenopausal black women with POAG or ocular hypertension.

"In this study we assessed, by simultaneous recordings of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and pattern-electroretinograms (PERGs), the effects cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine (citicoline) on retinal function and/ or visual cortical responses in glaucoma patients. Thirty glaucoma patients were randomly divided into two age-matched groups: patients in group GC (15 patients) were treated with citicoline (1000 mg/die intramuscularly) for 2 months; patients in group GP (15 patients) were treated with placebo for 2 months. After 4 months of wash-out (month 6), GC patients underwent a further 2-month period of citicoline treatment (months 7-8) followed by another 4-month period of wash-out (months 9-12). In GP patients the wash-out was extended for a further 6 months (months 7-12). During the following 13-96 months, GC patients received additional 2-month periods of treatment with citicoline (each period followed by 4 months of wash-out) for a total of 16 periods in 8 years. GP patients were also examined at months 24, 26, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96. In GC patients the first two treatments with citicoline induced a significant (p <0.01) improvement of VEP and PERG parameters with respect to pre-treatment conditions. VEPs and PERGs recorded in GC patients after the first wash-out revealed that, although there was a worsening trend, the electrophysiological improvement was still maintained with respect to baseline conditions. The additional periods of citicoline treatment in GC patients during the subsequent 13-96 months induced a greater (p < 0.01) improvement of VEP and PERG parameters with respect to pre-treatment conditions and when compared to GP patients. Thus, we observed that citicoline significantly improves retinal and cortical bioelectrical responses in glaucoma patients, suggesting a potential use of this substance in the medical treatment of glaucoma, as a complement to hypotensive therapy. copyright Springer 2005.

The influence of diclofenac ophthalmic solution on the intraocular pressure-lowering effect of topical 0.5% Timolol and 0.005% Latanoprost in primary open-angle glaucoma patients	Experimental eye research	Exp.Eye Res.	2005	81	5	610	615	"The aim of this randomized, prospective, masked clinical study has been to verify the influence of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ophthalmic solution on intraocular pressure reduction induced by 0.5% timolol and 0.005% latanoprost eyedrops in patients affected by primary open-angle glaucoma. Thirty-two glaucomatous patients, compensated with 0.5% timolol, were randomized into two study groups (A and B). Timolol was continued for the first 2 weeks in all subjects. On the 15th day, in both groups timolol was replaced by latanoprost, and this regimen lasted up to the end of the follow-up (8 weeks). At the beginning of the 2nd week of the study, group A additionally started a 5-week therapy with topical 0.1% diclofenac; during the same period, group B received placebo eyedrops with identical modalities. Intraocular pressure was recorded at 7-day intervals during the first 7 weeks and at the 10th week. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and placebo did not modify the effect of timolol on intraocular pressure. In both groups, latanoprost induced a significant decrease in intraocular pressure. Diclofenac-treated patients exhibited a marked fall in intraocular pressure (p<0.01), whereas in placebo-treated patients, this diminution was less noticeable (p<0.05). After diclofenac withdrawal, in group A intraocular pressure significantly increased (p<0.01), remaining approximately at the same level up to the end of the study. In group B, at the same checks no significant variations in intraocular pressure occurred. In primary open-angle glaucoma patients, diclofenac significantly enhances the hypotensive effect of latanoprost, without influence on timolol efficacy. Because non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely employed in medical practice, supplementary ophthalmologic checks should be scheduled during the co-administration of these compounds and prostaglandin analogues.

The Apraclonidine Maximum Tolerated Medical Therapy Study Group	Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society	Trans.Am.Ophthalmol.Soc.	1995	93	 	421	38; discussion 439-41	"OBJECT: We determined whether the addition of topical apraclonidine hydrochloride to eyes receiving maximal medical therapy, with inadequate intraocular pressure (IOP) control, and scheduled to undergo surgery, could adequately lower IOP, postponing the need for surgical intervention. DESIGN: A prospective 90 day, multi-centered, placebo-controlled, doublemasked parallel study. PATIENTS: We enrolled 174 glaucoma patients with inadequate IOP control on maximally tolerated medical therapy. All were candidates for either laser trabeculoplasty or invasive surgical intervention. We enrolled only one eye per patient. INTERVENTIONS: We continued to administer maximum-tolerated medical therapy for glaucoma. Patients took the study medication every eight hours. Study medications were either apraclonidine hydrochloride 0.5% or placebo (apraclonidine's vehicle). MAJOR OUTCOME MEASURES: We evaluated IOP, IOP change from baseline, and the number of eyes requiring surgery after the addition of study medication. RESULTS: Sixty one percent of patients treated with apraclonidine maintained adequate IOP control throughout the study, avoiding additional surgery compared to 33.9% patients treated with placebo (P  or = 20% reduction in IOP from baseline (resulting in an IOP < or = 20 mm Hg) (P < 0.05). The most common ocular complications were conjunctival hyperemia (12.6%), itching and foreign body sensation (6.8%), and tearing (4.5%). The most frequent non-ocular adverse events related to apraclonidine were dry mouth (4.5%) and unusual taste perception (2.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Apraclonidine appears safe and efficacious. It significantly lowered IOP when used in combination with a patient's maximum tolerated medical therapy. This delayed or prevented further glaucoma surgery for at least 90 days in approximately 60% of treated patients."

Lack of long-term drift in timolol's effectiveness in patients with ocular hypertension	Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science	Invest.Ophthalmol.Visual Sci.	2001	42	12	2839	2842	"PURPOSE. To report the change over time in intraocular pressure in patients treated with topical timolol or placebo. METHODS. Ninety patients with untreated ocular hypertension, defined as elevated intraocular pressure and normal visual fields, were randomly assigned to treatment and prospectively observed at 3-month intervals for up to 10 years in a double-masked fashion. The study end point was one eye showing reproducible glaucomatous field defects; patients were also withdrawn if one eye showed intraocular pressure of 35 mm Hg or higher. For each treatment group and visit, the mean and median of all intraocular pressure measurements were calculated. Medians were also calculated for the timolol group, assuming a worst-case scenario in which all patients who reached the end point, or intraocular pressure of 35 mm Hg or more, were assumed to show higher intraocular pressure than those remaining in the study. Distributions of slopes for intraocular pressure over time were compared between treatment groups. RESULTS. Means and medians of follow-up intraocular pressure over time did not differ between timolol- and placebo-treated patients. This was also true when assuming a worst-case scenario. Slopes of intraocular pressure over time did not differ statistically between treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS. In agreement with other masked and controlled studies and in conflict with uncontrolled ones, the present study did not demonstrate long-term drift of intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension treated with topical timolol."

Methods: A 30-day, randomized, investigator-masked, clinical trial involving 100 patients with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Study medications were instilled topically. Doses of 0.003%, 0.01%, or 0.03% AGN 192024 were given once daily for 3 weeks then twice daily for 1 week, and vehicle control or 0.5% timolol was given twice daily for 4 weeks. Mean change in IOP from baseline was the primary efficacy variable. Safety parameters included adverse events, hyperemia grading, laser flare meter analysis, heart rate, and blood pressure. Results: Timolol and all 3 concentrations of AGN 192024 lowered IOP from baseline (P<.001). A dosage of 0.03% AGN 192024 once dailylowered IOP significantly more than timolol (P[less-than or equal to].02) at every study visit except day 21 (P=.053) and provided better diurnal IOP control. Twice-daily dosing of AGN 192024 provided no clinically significant benefit over once-daily dosing. All treatment regimens were safe and well tolerated, with no clinically significant effects on heart rate or blood pressure and no between-group differences in the incidence of adverse events. The only significant ocular safety finding with AGN 192024 was a dose-related mild increase in conjunctival hyperemia. Conclusions: Of the 3 concentrations tested, 0.03% AGN 192024 once daily had the best therapeutic profile. AGN 192024 was safe and well tolerated, and it provided superior ocular hypotensive efficacy and diurnal IOP control compared with timolol in patients with ocular hypertension and glaucoma."

Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to latanoprost administered once daily or to usual care (any other commercially available medication). Patients were examined at baseline and every 6 months for 5 years. RESULTS: In all, 5854 patients were included (latanoprost, 3936; usual care, 1918).

DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, investigator-masked clinical trial. METHODS: After washout of glaucoma medications, ocular hypertension or glaucoma patients were randomly assigned to once-daily bimatoprost 0.03% (n = 133) or latanoprost 0.005% (n = 136) for 6 months. The primary outcome measure was mean change from baseline IOP (8 AM, 12 PM, 4 PM). Secondary measures included mean IOP, ophthalmologic examination, adverse events, and the percentage of patients reaching specific target IOPs. RESULTS: Mean change from baseline IOP was significantly greater for bimatoprost patients than for latanoprost patients at all measurements on each study visit; 1.5 mm Hg greater at 8 AM (P 15 to [less-than or equal to] 18 mm Hg, and > 18 mm Hg) showed that bimatoprost produced lower target pressures compared with latanoprost at all times measured (P [less-than or equal to] .026). Few patients were discontinued for adverse events (6 on bimatoprost; 5 on latanoprost). On ophthalmologic examination, conjunctival hyperemia (P < .001) and eyelash growth (P = .064) were more common in bimatoprost patients.

This was a randomized, double-masked, multi-center, active-controlled, 2-period, crossover study. After a 3-week, single-masked placebo run-in phase, patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma and an intraocular pressure (IOP) > or = 22 mmHg were randomized to receive timolol gel QD or levobunolol BID for 6 weeks followed by a 3-week, placebo washout period. Patients were then crossed over to the alternate treatment for 6 weeks. IOP and heart rate (HR) were measured at 3 and 6 weeks after the start of therapy with either timolol gel or levobunolol. Of 133 patients randomized, 116 received both treatments. Timolol gel QD was comparable to levobunolol BID in reducing trough and peak IOP. At trough, HR was marginally increased with timolol gel and was decreased with levobunolol (p = < 0.001). At peak, HR was decreased with both treatments, but the decrease was significantly less with timolol gel than with levobunolol (p = 0.049). Significantly more patients experienced at least one adverse event (p = 0.024), adverse events related to special senses (p = 0.002), and burning and stinging (p < 0.001) with levobunolol compared to timolol gel.

METHODS: In a previously described, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel group study, patients received either 0.005% latanoprost once daily (n = 128) or 0.5% timolol twice daily (n = 140) for 6 months. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was assessed at baseline and at 0.5, 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 months of treatment at 8 am on all visits, and also at noon and 4 pm at baseline and 6 months. Rate of response based on diurnal measurement at 6 months compared with baseline was assessed using several criteria for response. Eyes with an IOP reduction of less than 15% compared with baseline at 8 am arbitrarily were classified as non-responders at each of the 5 visits during treatment. Consistency of non-responder classifications for individual eyes was assessed. RESULTS: Mean IOP reduction was greater (P < 0.001) in latanoprost-versus timolol-treated patients throughout the course of therapy. A greater rate of response occurred in patients treated with latanoprost, and differences in response rates between the 2 drugs increased as the definitions of response became more stringent. A greater percentage of non-responders at any single visit were classified as responders at all other visits with latanoprost in comparison with timolol. CONCLUSIONS: Latanoprost produces a greater rate of response compared with timolol. A higher percentage of non-responders to latanoprost compared with timolol on any individual visit are responders on all other visits. Likewise, a higher proportion of patients who do not initially respond will become responders with continued treatment with latanoprost compared with timolol."

After appropriate washout, patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomly allocated to receive Trav/Tim (AM) plus Tim Vehicle (PM); Tim Vehicle (AM) plus Trav (PM); or Tim (AM & PM). Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at 8 AM, 10 AM, and 4 PM at baseline, Week 2, Week 6, and Month 3. Results: Trav/Tim produced statistically significant and clinically relevant IOP reductions from baseline, with mean reductions ranging from 9-12 mmHg (32-38%).

In the larger study, the additive effect of dorzolamide administered twice daily also was compared with 2% pilocarpine. METHODS: Both studies were parallel, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled comparisons. In the pilot study, 32 patients received 0.5% timolol twice daily plus either 2% dorzolamide twice daily or placebo twice daily for 8 days. In the Pilocarpine Comparison Study, 261 patients received 0.5% timolol twice daily plus 0.7% dorzolamide twice daily, 2% dorzolamide twice daily, 2% pilocarpine four times daily, or placebo (twice daily or 4 times daily) for 2 weeks.

RESULTS: In the pilot study, after 8 days, additional mean percent reductions in IOP for 2% dorzolamide and placebo were 17% and 3% at morning trough and 19% and 2% at peak, respectively. In the Pilocarpine Comparison Study, after 6 months, additional mean percent reductions in IOP (morning trough) were 9%, 13%, and 10% for 0.7% dorzolamide, 2% dorzolamide, and 2% pilocarpine, respectively. Patients receiving 2% pilocarpine had the highest rate of discontinuation due to a clinical adverse experience, and the use of dorzolamide was not associated with systemic side effects commonly observed with the use of oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

METHODS: This was a 30-day, multicenter, double-masked, randomized, clinical trial. Patients (n = 64) diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomly assigned to receive bimatoprost 0.03%, latanoprost 0.005%, or vehicle topically in both eyes once daily, in the evening, for 29 days. The primary endpoint was the reduction in IOP from baseline on day 14 and day 29. Secondary outcome measures included eye examinations and safety parameters. RESULTS: Bimatoprost and latanoprost significantly lowered IOP from baseline (p <.001). Bimatoprost lowered IOP more than latanoprost at every timepoint measured (bimatoprost: 25-34% reduction, 5.9-8.9 mm Hg; latanoprost: 20-31% reduction, 4.4-7.9 mm Hg), although the between-group differences did not reach statistical significance. Over the 12-hour course of IOP measurements on day 29, bimatoprost provided better diurnal IOP control than latanoprost (p =.0378, area under the curve of diurnal IOP reductions, 1-way ANOVA with pairwise t-test). Both treatment regimens were safe and well tolerated, with no significant between-group differences in reports of specific adverse events. The most common side effect was conjunctival hyperemia, which was similarly apparent in the bimatoprost and latanoprost treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: At the end of this 30-day trial, once-daily bimatoprost 0.03% provided better diurnal IOP control than latanoprost and was safe and well tolerated in patients with ocular hypertension and glaucoma."

The mean decrease in intraocular pressure from baseline was significantly greater with timolol than with epinephrine both before crossover and overall at both the lowest and highest concentrations of drug used. Significantly toxicity was produced in four patients during treatment with epinephrine, but in no patients during treatment with timolol."

A correlation between the intraocular pressure-lowering effect of unoprostone and latanoprost was also evaluated. METHODS: A single-masked randomized study included 18 patients between 49 and 68 years (mean, 60.7 +/- 5.1 years) with an intraocular pressure of both eyes from 21 to 27 mm Hg. The patients were prospectively randomized to receive latanoprost in the right eye and unoprostone in the left eye, or unoprostone in the right eye and latanoprost in the left eye. The patients were followed up for 8 weeks. This study evaluated the intraocular pressure-lowering effect and incidence of drug-related side effects. RESULTS: Mean baseline intraocular pressure was 22.8 +/- 1.2 mm Hg in latanoprost-treated eyes and 22.4 +/- 1.0 mm Hg in unoprostone-treated eyes; there was no statistically significant difference between these groups. Mean intraocular pressure at 8 weeks after the start of the administration was 16.7 +/- 2.0 mm Hg in latanoprost-treated eyes and 19.0 +/- 1.5 mm Hg in unoprostone-treated eyes. Patients in the latanoprost-treated group showed a greater intraocular pressure reduction compared with those in the unoprostone-treated group. Mean intraocular pressure changes in latanoprost-treated eyes were significantly greater at every visit (P < 0.0001). A change of intraocular pressure at 8 weeks in the latanoprost-treated eyes was significantly correlated with that in the contralateral unoprostone-treated eyes (r = 0.665, P = 0.0013) (Figure). There was no significant difference in the rate of ocular side effects between latanoprost- and unoprostone-treated eyes. CONCLUSIONS: Latanoprost appears to have a more beneficial effect for intraocular pressure control compared with unoprostone. An intraocular pressure reduction in the latanoprost-treated eyes was significantly correlated with that in the contralateral unoprostone-treated eyes. There was no significant difference in the incidence of ocular side effects between both drugs. Further investigation using more cases and longer follow-up periods are needed."

Each then started unoprostone 0.15% (Rescula) in one randomly assigned eye and latanoprost 0.005% (Xalatan) in the other. Unoprostone was administered at 8 AM and 8 PM and latanoprost at 8 PM with placebo at 8 AM, both from masked bottles. After 28 days, differences were determined for each measured variable by two-tailed paired t test.RESULTS: Starting from similar baseline IOP levels, after 1 month of treatment, the mean morning IOP values differed according to the topical agent received (16.2 +/- SEM 0.6 mm Hg for latanoprost vs 17.9 +/- 0.7 mm Hg for unoprostone; P =.001). These morning pressures were 2.6 mm Hg lower than baseline in the eyes receiving latanoprost (P <.0001), and 1.6 mm Hg lower in unoprostone-treated eyes (P =.02). Afternoon values were 3.1 +/- SEM 0.6 lower than corresponding baseline in eyes receiving latanoprost, and 2.4 +/- SEM 0.6 mm Hg in unoprostone-treated eyes (P <.0001 from baseline for both medications; interdrug mean IOP difference; P =.04). Eyes receiving unoprostone showed a 1.7-db improvement in frequency doubling mean deviation (P =.03), the only significant visual function change observed. Pulsatile ocular blood flow increased 30% relative to baseline in eyes receiving latanoprost, (P <.0001) and 16% in eyes receiving unoprostone (P =.05) by the morning of day 28. That afternoon, mean POBF had increased 30% (P <.0001) relative to afternoon baseline values among eyes receiving latanoprost and 18% (P =.03) among those receiving unoprostone (interdrug change difference, P =.05). Humphrey perimetry and contrast sensitivity remained stable with both prostanoids.CONCLUSIONS: Both latanoprost and unoprostone produced significant reductions in IOP and increases in POBF, with stable central and perimacular visual function. Latanoprost once daily produced IOP reduction and POBF increases nearly twofold greater than those obtained with unoprostone twice daily. These differences in IOP and POBF change between unoprostone and latanoprost were statistically significant.

METHODS: This study was a 90-day prospective, multicenter, double-masked, randomized, parallel group trial. Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were made between 8:00 and 10:00 AM before the morning dose (i.e., up to 12 hours after the evening dose of glaucoma medication) and at 4:00 PM (i.e., 8 hours after the morning dose of glaucoma medication). Patients with off-therapy IOP of greater than 22 mmHg and less than 35 mmHg were entered into the study and were assessed 14, 30, and 90 days after treatment. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were enrolled; there were no significant demographic differences among the three study groups. All three treatments significantly reduced IOP over 90 days (P < 0.011). For apraclonidine 0.5%, IOP reductions from 25.8 +/- 3.2 mmHg (pretreatment) to 20.4 +/- 4.00 mmHg (day 90) were observed; for apraclonidine 0.25%, from 25.7 +/- 3.05 mmHg (pretreatment) to 22.1 +/- 4.24 mmHg (day 90); and for timolol 0.5% from 26.1 +/- 3.79 mmHg to 21.1 +/- 5.91 mmHg (day 90). The 90-day period of therapy was completed by 12 patients treated with apraclonidine 0.5%, 21 patients treated with apraclonidine 0.25%, and 23 patients treated with timolol 0.5%. There were no serious adverse events. Fourteen of 22 patients (0.5% apraclonidine) and 21 of 23 patients (0.25% apraclonidine) tolerated the drug well; ocular allergy developed in the remaining patients treated with apraclonidine, which resolved upon discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Apraclonidine effectively lowers IOP associated with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension; these pilot results will need to be confirmed by a larger pivotal study. Long-term therapy for some patients may be inhibited by ocular allergy for which there was a higher incidence to the 0.5% apraclonidine solution than to the 0.25% solution in this study. Apraclonidine may be of value as an additional therapy for open-angle glaucoma in selected patients.

Equivalence of conventional and sustained release oral dosage formulations of acetazolamide in primary open angle glaucoma	British journal of clinical pharmacology	Br.J.Clin.Pharmacol.	1989	27	5	597	606	"1. Outpatients with primary open angle glaucoma uncontrolled on single topical therapy with either pilocarpine or timolol were recruited for a stratified double dummy cross over trial. Once or twice daily sustained release acetazolamide (SRA) was compared with an identical regimen of conventional tablets (CA). 2. During the run in period the patients received 500 mg SRA once or twice daily as needed to control intraocular pressure (IOP). The dose was thereafter kept constant and patients were allocated randomly to 4 weeks treatment with CA followed by 4 weeks SRA or vice versa. IOP and venous plasma concentrations of acetazolamide were measured at weekly intervals. At the end of each 4 week course, patients were admitted for a 24 h profile of IOP and drug concentration measurements. 3. Thirty-five patients were recruited, but eleven were withdrawn during the run in period largely because of adverse effects; these became less troublesome when it was decided to give the once daily dose at 22.00 h. Four were withdrawn during the cross over, two because of inadequate IOP control. Twenty completed the trial. 4. The morning plasma concentration of acetazolamide measured each week showed no tendency to accumulation during the study. The mean swing (maximum minus minimum) in plasma acetazolamide concentration during the 24 h profile was less (P less than 0.005) with the SR formulation (11.6 +/- 4.9; mg l-1) +/- s.d.) than with the conventional (15.5 +/- 4.7) but the mean concentrations over the 24 h profile were indistinguishable (P greater than 0.05; 9.7 +/- 3.8 and 8.6 +/- 2.8 respectively). 5. Satisfactory control of IOP (no more than one reading above 22 mmHg) was maintained despite the changes in formulation in all but two of the patients who entered the cross over study. No close relationship between IOP and plasma concentration of acetazolamide was found. The 24 h IOP profiles whilst receiving each of the formulations were indistinguishable; thus the smoothing of the plasma drug concentration profile achieved by the SR formulation did not reduce the amplitude of swings in IOP. Similarly, no difference was observed between the formulations with respect to adverse effects. 6. It is concluded that the SR and conventional formulations were equivalent with respect to mean plasma acetazolamide concentration, IOP control and adverse effects. The SR formulation did not show practical advantages over the conventional formulation which was equally effective even with dosage intervals of 12 or 24 h.

"In a 4-year, double-masked, parallel, multicenter study comparing the efficacy and safety of levobunolol and timolol, 391 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomly assigned to receive masked 0.5% or 1% levobunolol, or 0.5% timolol, twice daily. Mean decreases in intraocular pressure (IOP) over 4 years of therapy were 7.1, 7.2, and 7.0 mmHg for 0.5% levobunolol, 1% levobunolol, or 0.5% timolol, respectively. Little attenuation of ocular hypotensive efficacy occurred. The 4-year efficacy failure rate for the three groups, which did not differ from each other, was approximately 30%. Adverse experiences requiring cessation of therapy occurred in an additional 10% of patients. The vast majority of efficacy failures (79/95) and of adverse events (33/37) requiring removal from the study occurred during the first 2 years. Overall mean decreases in heart rate for the 4 years ranged from 3 to 6 beats per minute for all treatment groups; overal mean decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure ranged between 1 and 2 mmHg.

METHODS: After a medicine-free period, qualified patients were randomized to either placebo dosed in the morning with a latanoprost-timolol fixed combination dosed in the evening or timolol alone dosed twice daily for 8 weeks. Patients were then switched to the opposite treatment for 8 weeks. At baseline and at the end of each treatment period, patients underwent IOP measurements. RESULTS: Both treatments reduced the IOP from untreated baseline at each time point and for the 24-hour curve (P<.001). When treatments were compared, the latanoprost-timolol fixed combination decreased the IOP more than timolol alone at each time point and for the 24-hour curve (2.9 mm Hg), and provided a lower absolute IOP at each time point (P<.001) and for the range (fluctuation) in IOP (P = .003) and for the 24-hour curve. Several adverse effects were observed more often with the latanoprost-timolol fixed combination, including ocular stinging (P = .05), conjunctival hyperemia (P = .02), and ocular itching (P = .04). CONCLUSION: The evening-dosed latanoprost-timolol fixed combination may provide better IOP control than timolol alone over 24 hours and may demonstrate a narrower range of IOP fluctuation in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma.

METHODS: An open-label safety surveillance study was conducted in 14 countries. Patients on intraocular pressure (IOP)-reducing therapy other than latanoprost were eligible if they required a change in therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to latanoprost administered once daily or to usual care (any other commercially available medication). Patients were examined at baseline and every 6 months for 5 years. RESULTS: In all, 5854 patients were included (latanoprost, 3936; usual care, 1918). Of those initially randomized to latanoprost, 2707 (68.8%) completed the study, and 4638 (79.2%) patients received at least one dose of latanoprost.

METHODS: In all, 80 eyes of 80 POAG patients with IOP inadequately controlled by TDC were randomly assigned to receive either latanoprost 0.005% or brimonidine 0.2%. IOP measurements were recorded at 1000 (peak effect) and 1600 (trough effect) on day 0 (baseline) and at 1 and 3 months. At each stage and time point, the mean IOP reductions from baseline were evaluated for both groups, and success rates (minimum 15% reduction) were determined. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean peak/trough IOPs with TDC were 20.2/21.6 and 19.9/21.4 mmHg in latanoprost and brimonidine groups, respectively. Latanoprost+TDC reduced the mean peak/trough IOP by 4.4/3.4 and 5.2/3.5 mmHg at 1 and 3 months. The corresponding values for brimonidine+TDC were 3.9/2.9 and 4.6/2.9 mmHg. Each of these results represented a significant reduction from baseline (P0.05 for all). With the latanoprost+TDC combination, the peak/trough success rates at 1 and 3 months were 76.3%/42.1% and 77.1%/40%. The corresponding values with the brimonidine+TDC combination were 71.8%/41% and 77.7%/41.7%. There were no significant differences in the groups' success rates at any time point (P>0.05 for all).

METHODS: This was a prospective, double-masked, randomized, controlled, cross-over evaluation. After a 6-week wash-out period, the patients then returned for baseline diurnal curve testing every 2 h (8 AM to 8 PM). Patients with an IOP of 22-29 mmHg inclusive at 8 AMwere randomized to either bimatoprost dosed each evening or DTFC twice-daily. Patients returned in 8 weeks for the Period 1 diurnal curve and were switched to the opposite treatment. Patients again returned in 8 weeks for the Period 2 diurnal curve. RESULTS: Of the 29 patients, mean untreated baseline IOP (visit 2) was 24.6 +/- 2.6 mmHg and treatment mean IOP was statistically lower with bimatoprost 17.6 +/- 2.0 mmHg than for DTFC 18.8 +/- 2.5 mmHg (P = 0.03), as was the IOP range (P = 0.02) and IOP peak (P = 0.003). No significant differences were found between DTFC and bimatoprost at individual time points after a modified Bonferroni correction (>0.02). DTFC demonstrated a greater incidence of stinging or burning (n = 12) than bimatoprost (n = 0; P = < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that OAG patients generally can obtain similar IOP control at individual time points (when a Bonferroni correction is considered) by switching to either DTFC or bimatoprost, but overall diurnal control is statistically better with bimatoprost."

After 4 weeks, all patients received both latanoprost and unoprostone for another 4 weeks. The IOP was measured at 9 am and 5 pm on the baseline, day 28, and day 56 visits, and at 9 am on day 14 and day 42 visits. The medications were given to the patients in an open label fashion. The observer was masked to the treatment given. The mean of the measurements was calculated. Safety parameters were also recorded. The additive effect of the medications was assessed by the reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) when both medications were used, compared with when one medication was used. RESULTS: 28 patients completed both treatment periods and had IOP data available for evaluation. After 1 month of treatment, latanoprost significantly reduced IOP (mean by 6.1 (SEM 0.8) mm Hg (p<0.001) and unoprostone by 4.9 (1.0) mm Hg (p<0.001) from the baseline of 24.4 (0.6) mm Hg and 24.4 (1.1) mm Hg respectively (p = 0.18). When latanoprost once daily was given to patients treated with unoprostone, there was additional IOP lowering of 1.9 (0.6) mm Hg (p = 0.012). However, adding unoprostone to those being treated with latanoprost produced an IOP change of +0.4 (0.5) mm Hg (p = 0.42). Ocular symptoms and findings were mild and equally distributed between treatment groups, and after combined therapy. Hyperaemia and ocular irritation were the most frequently reported events. Over a third of patients experienced ocular irritation with the combination of medications. CONCLUSIONS: Latanoprost once daily causes additional IOP lowering in eyes which were being treated with unoprostone twice a day.

METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, clinical effectiveness trial in which the clinical outcomes of twice daily brimonidine tartrate 0.2% were compared with those of timolol maleate 0.5% in patients with glaucoma and' ocular hypertension was conducted. Two hundred nineteen patients were enrolled--111 in the brimonidine group and 108 in the timolol group. Patients instilled their study medications twice daily for 4 months. Factors for determining clinical success were reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP), safety, and adverse events. Quality of life effects were assessed with the SF-36 Health Survey and Glaucoma Disability Index questionnaires. RESULTS: Clinical success was 71% (75/106) with brimonidine and 70% (73/105) with timolol as initial treatment. The overall mean decrease in IOP was 6.5 mm Hg with brimonidine and 6.2 mm Hg with timolol. Few patients reported a specific adverse event and, with the exception of a slightly higher rate of ocular burning and stinging in the brimonidine group, there were no significant between-group differences. No significant chronotropic effects on the heart were seen with brimonidine, while small but significant mean decreases in heart rate were seen at months 1 and 4 with timolol. Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained relatively stable in both groups. Quality of life remained stable, with no significant between-group differences. CONCLUSIONS: As a first-line agent for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, brimonidine has clinical effectiveness equivalent to timolol, but with less chronotropic effect on the heart. Brimonidine is a viable alternative to timolol for first-line therapy in glaucoma and ocular hypertension."

Then, after a 4-week washout period, patients received the opposing treatment for 6 weeks. Both latanoprost and timolol maleate significantly lowered IOP from baseline in both black and white patients. Latanoprost treatment was associated with lower mean IOP compared with timolol treatment in black patients (P = .013 at 8 AM, P = .19 at 10 AM). At 10 AM at the end of the treatment period, the mean +/- SD change from baseline IOP in black patients receiving latanoprost was significantly greater than that of white patients (-10.2 +/- 7.0 and -5.9 +/- 2.5 mm Hg, respectively; P = .042). The mean +/- SD change from baseline IOPs in black patients was not significantly different from that in white patients at 8 AM at the end of the treatment period for the latanoprost group and at 8 AM and 10 AM at the end of the treatment period for the timolol maleate group. In white patients, the change from baseline IOP in light (grade 1) irises was not significantly different from dark (grade 5) irises after treatment with either latanoprost or timolol maleate. In summary, intraocular pressure after treatment with latanoprost was lower than that after timolol treatment in black patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, and at 1 of 2 timepoints, latanoprost caused a significantly greater reduction of IOP in black patients than in white patients.

Sixty-five individuals considered to be at moderate risk for developing open-angle glaucoma were recruited for the study. In each patient, one eye was chosen randomly to receive timolol twice-daily while the fellow eye received diluent (placebo). Timolol administration reduced IOP from baseline in the treated eyes over the course of the study by a mean +/- SD of 4.9 +/- 3.4 mm Hg. Timolol administration also produced a mean +/- SD contralateral reduction of IOP from baseline in the untreated fellow eyes of 2.9 +/- 3.1 mm Hg. The mean +/- SD difference in IOP between the treated and untreated eyes during the study was 2.3 +/- 2.6 mm Hg. Over the course of the study reproducible visual field loss developed in 4 timolol treated eyes and 10 placebo treated eyes (P = .039, McNemar test). Clinical progressive optic disc cupping was noted in four treated and eight untreated eyes (P = .11, McNemar test). In the 42 subjects who completed a minimum 4-year follow-up, baseline and final optic disc photographs were analyzed using a computer image analysis system to determine changes in the area of disc pallor. The mean +/- SD increase in optic disc pallor was 0.86% +/- 2.4% in the timolol treated eyes and 1.80% +/- 3.6% in the placebo treated eyes. This difference was statistically significant (P = .04, paired t-test). This study provides evidence that medical treatment prevents or delays the onset of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic disc damage in individuals with ocular hypertension. The magnitude of the protective effect of timolol was partially obscured by the contralateral reduction of IOP in the placebo treated fellow eyes."

Comparison of latanoprost and dorzolamide in the treatment of patients with open angle glaucoma	"Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad: JAMC"	 	2004	16	1	50	53	"BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to compare the effects on intraocular pressure and side effects of monotherapy with either latanoprost or dorzolamide in patients with open angle glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation glaucoma or ocular hypertension. METHODS: Sixty patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were recruited to a 3-month study. Previous glaucoma medications were washed out and the patients were randomised to receive either latanoprost 0.005% once daily or dorzolamide 2% three times daily. The follow-up visits were conducted at two weeks, one months and three months of study and intraocular pressures and slit lamp examinations were carried out to look for response of therapy and detect complications. RESULTS: After 3 months, latanoprost reduced mean baseline intraocular pressure from 27.2 +/- 3.0 mm Hg by 8.5 +/- 3.3 mm Hg. The corresponding figures for dorzolamide were 27.2 +/- 3.4 and 5.6 +/- 2.6 mm Hg. The difference of 2.9 mm Hg (95% CI: 2.3-3.6) was highly significant (p < 0.001). Both drugs were well tolerated systemically and locally. CONCLUSION: Latanoprost was superior to dorzolamide in reducing the intraocular pressure, judged from the effect on mean intraocular pressure. The once daily dose in the evening ensures better compliance and the problem of hyperpigmentation of the iris were not encountered.

DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial and a prospective, non-randomized comparative replacement trial. PARTICIPANTS/INTERVENTIONS: In a national multicentre trial, 131 patients were randomized to dorzolamide-timolol or a topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (CAI) and non-selective beta-blocker following a 1-month run-in using the separate components. Peak (maximal drug effect) and trough (minimal drug effect) IOPs were measured at baseline and 1 month after treatment. The replacement therapy study enrolled 404 consecutive glaucoma patients using a non-selective beta-blocker and dorzolamide and changed treatment to the fixed combination. Mean IOPs at the same time of day were compared before and 1 month after changeover. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measure was IOP, comparing baseline and on-therapy measurements at study conclusion between the two arms of the randomized trial and before and after switching therapy in the replacement trial. RESULTS: In the randomized trial, the mean baseline peak and trough IOPs were 18.4 and 21.0 mmHg in the group randomized to combination therapy and 17.6 and 19.8 mmHg in the dual drug group. After randomization and treatment for four weeks, the peak and trough IOPs were 17.6 and 19.5 mmHg in the combination group and 17.3 and 19.0 mmHg in the concomitant group. The percentage change in IOP was -3.2% at peak and -6.5% at trough for the combination and -0.3 and -3.2% for the concomitant group. These differences did not show statistical significance. In the replacement study, mean baseline IOP was 19.4 mmHg. Four weeks after initiation of treatment on the fixed combination, a significant additional IOP reduction of 1.7 mmHg (-8.8%) was observed (P < 0.0001). Overall, 81% of eyes exhibited equal or lower IOP on the fixed combination compared with concomitant therapy. CONCLUSION: The results of the randomized trial indicate that the fixed combination dorzolamide-timolol (Cosopt) was as effective as its components in controlling IOP, confirming results seen in phase 3 clinical trials. However, in the replacement study, utilization of the combination drug offered a statistically significant additional IOP reduction (P < 0.0001), which duplicates results from previous replacement studies."

DESIGN: Interventional study. METHODS: This 12-week, randomized, parallel-group study was conducted at 45 US sites. Previously treated patients with OAG or OH and an IOP [greater-than or equal to]23 mm Hg in one or both eyes after washout received either latanoprost 0.005%, bimatoprost 0.03%, or travoprost 0.004% once daily in the evening. At baseline and after 6 and 12 weeks of therapy, masked evaluators measured IOP in triplicate at 8:00 AM, 12 noon, 4:00 PM, and 8:00 PM, and masked investigators graded conjunctival hyperemia before the 8:00 AM IOP measurement. The primary efficacy outcome measure was change between baseline and Week 12 in the 8:00 AM IOP (time of peak drug effect). RESULTS: In all, 410 of 411 randomized patients were included in intent-to-treat analyses (latanoprost, 136; bimatoprost, 136; travoprost, 138). Baseline mean 8:00 AM IOP levels were similar (P = .772); by week 12, reductions were observed in all 3 groups (P < .001 for each). Adjusted (ANCOVA) reductions in mean IOP at 8:00 AM were similar (P = .128) as were those at 12 noon, 4:00 PM, and 8:00 PM. Fewer latanoprost-treated patients reported ocular adverse events (P < .001, latanoprost vs bimatoprost), fewer reported hyperemia (P = .001, latanoprost vs bimatoprost), and average hyperemia scores were lower at week 12 (P = .001, latanoprost vs bimatoprost).

"Comparison of the ocular effects of three beta-blockers: Timolol, carteolol, and betaxolol"	Annals of Ophthalmology Glaucoma.	 	1996	28	5	317	320	"A modern glaucoma therapy cannot base its effectiveness on the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect only. Much more attention should be given to the preservation of the visual function and to the ocular tolerability of these drugs. The authors compared the ocular tolerability and the influence of three beta-blockers-timolol, carteolol, and betaxolol-on the visual field of glaucoma patients in a double-blind 12-month study. Thirty- six patients affected by open- angle glaucoma were selected, all of whom showed an lOP of greater than 23 mm Hg without therapy, clinical signs of glaucomatous optic nerve head damage, and an initial glaucomatous visual field defect. Patient examinations included blood pressure measurement, pulse rate, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, Goldmann's applanation tonometry, visual acuity and refraction, corneal sensitivity performed by a Cochet-Bonnet aestestiometer, Schirmer's basal tear secretion test with topical anesthesia, and perimetry using an Octopus 2000R (Interzeag AG, Suisse) G1 program. The results showed that carteolol, betaxolol, and timolol reduce the lOP and may play a role in visual field preservation. It was found that timolol tended to have a better influence on the visual fields and to reduce IOP better than betaxolol and carteolol. The three drugs were well tolerated in this study, although betaxolol caused transient stinging on instillation in many patients and reduced the corneal sensitivity. Copyright Œ© 2009 Elsevier B.

Methods: Thirty-seven ocular hypertensives were randomly assigned to placebo or 0.5% timolol drops to both eyes in a double masked clinical trial. Measurements of ocular pressure and photographs of the optic disc for cupping by photogrammetry and pallor by computerized image analysis were made at about 3 month intervals, for 18 to 24 months of follow-up. Results: None of the subjects developed visual field loss when tested with the Goldmann perimeter by kinetic and static means at six month intervals. Subjects treated with timolol developed a significant decrease in ocular pressure and a significant decrease in optic disc cupping with a smaller decrease in pallor compared to subjects treated with placebo. Multivariate analyses indicated that the decrease of optic disc cupping and pallor was not associated with the ocular pressure on treatment or the decrease in ocular pressure during the trial. Conclusion: Timolol treatment was associated with a decrease in optic disc cupping and pallor. The effect of timolol appears to be related to mechanisms other than the decrease in ocular pressure."

Design and setting: IOP measures were derived from a 12-month randomised, double-masked, double-dummy, phase III clinical trial conducted in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension. IOP was measured at weeks 2, 12, 24 and 48, at 8am, 10am and 4pm. The visual field defect (VFD) risk functions estimated by Stewart were applied, the statistical unit being the eye. A second-order analysis of variance was performed including eye, time, treatment and investigator. Analyses according to baseline IOP were performed to identify patients at risk. Interventions: IOP-lowering drugs: travoprost 0.004% once daily, latanoprost 0.005% once daily and timolol 0.5% twice daily. Outcome measure: Daily IOP average and variance, and daily minimum and maximum IOP and VFD. Results: Travoprost-treated patients (n = 200) had a daily IOP average significantly lower than timolol-treated patients (n = 200; p < 0.0001) and latanoprost-treated patients (n = 196; p < 0.001). Similar results were found for daily minimal and maximal IOP values. No difference was found for IOP variance between the prostaglandin analogues (p < 0.25), while timolol-treated patients had a higher value than travoprost-treated patients (p < 0.004). Consequently, patients treated with timolol would have a 1.54 greater chance of developing a new VFD over 5 years than those using latanoprost. Patients treated with latanoprost would have a 1.11 greater chance of developing a new VFD than travoprost-treated patients. Conclusions: Better control of daily IOP average and variance should avoid new VFDs. Prostaglandins controlled the variance better than timolol, and travoprost was found to be the drug having the most effect on IOP average. Longitudinal prospective data collection should be performed to confirm these findings. Copyright Œ© 2009 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam. All Rights Reserved."

METHODS: This prospective, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational study enrolled 333 adults with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. During the six-week dose-response phase, patients were randomized to thrice-daily dosing of four treatments: 0.2%, 0.7%, or 2.0% dorzolamide or placebo (vehicle of dorzolamide). During a one-year extension, patients received 0.7% or 2.0% dorzolamide, and, if needed, 0.5% timolol twice daily for elevated IOP. RESULTS: In the dose-response phase, mean percent reduction of IOP (peak) was 16% to 18% for 2.0% and 0.7% dorzolamide and 4% to 7% for the placebo group, for a net reduction of IOP by dorzolamide of 11% to 14%. The 0.2% concentration of dorzolamide was not sufficiently active for further consideration. During the extension, dorzolamide maintained an adequate reduction of IOP in 55% (174 of 316) of patients. Throughout the study, the reduction in IOP was numerically greater for patients receiving 2.0% vs 0.7% dorzolamide.

A VF change during the follow-up must be confirmed by two further positive tests. Optic disc change is defined by the agreement of two out of three independent observers evaluating optic disc stereo-slides. Results: One thousand seventy-seven subjects were randomized between January 1, 1997 and May 31, 1999. The mean age was 57.03 +/- 10.3 years; 54.41% were women and 99.9% were Caucasian. Mean IOP was 23.6 +/- 1.6 mmHg in both eyes. Mean visual acuity was 0.97 +/- 0.11 in both eyes; mean refraction was 0.23 +/- 1.76 diopters in the right eye and 0.18 +/- 1.79 diopters in the left eye. Previous use of medication for ocular hypertension was reported by 38.4% of the patients, systemic hypertension by 28.1%, cardiovascular diseases by 12.9%, and diabetes mellitus by 4.7%. The qualifying VFs were normal and reliable according to protocol criteria. Conclusions: The mean IOP of the patients enrolled in the European Glaucoma Prevention Study is consistent with the estimated mean IOP (within the range of 22-29 mmHg) found in a large sample of the European population. The European Glaucoma Prevention Study should be able to better address the clinical question of whether pharmacological reduction of IOP (by means of dorzolamide) in ocular hypertension patients at moderate risk for developing primary open-angle glaucoma effectively lowers the incidence of primary open-angle glaucoma. copyright 2002 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology."

DESIGN: Randomized, prospective, crossover comparison. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-nine patients had primary open-angle glaucoma, and 14 patients had ocular hypertension. METHODS: After a 6-week washout period, patients were randomized to either 6 months of treatment with the DTFC twice daily or latanoprost every evening and then crossed over to the opposite treatment for an additional 6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mean 24-hour IOP after 2 and 6 months of treatment. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients had an average 24-hour baseline IOP of 25.2+/-2.3 mmHg. After 6 months of treatment, 24-hour IOPs were 18.1+/-1.9 mmHg for the DTFC and 18.3+/-1.9 mmHg for latanoprost. Compared with 2 months of therapy, at 6 months the DTFC showed no significant change in mean 24-hour IOP, whereas latanoprost demonstrated a reduction of 0.3 mmHg (P = 0.01). The DTFC had more burning (P<0.001) and bitter taste (P = 0.01), whereas the latanoprost had more hypertrichosis (P = 0.02).

DESIGN: Multi-center clinical trial. METHODS: We compared the medication and observation groups of the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) during 6.3 years of follow-up with regard to the rate of cataract and combined cataract/filtering surgery, and change from baseline in visual function, refraction, and visual symptoms. A one-time assessment of lens opacification was done using the Lens Opacities Classification System III (LOCS III) grading system. RESULTS: An increased rate of cataract extraction and cataract/filtering surgery was found in the medication group (7.6%) compared with the observation group (5.6%) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05 to 2.29). The medication and observation groups did not differ with regard to changes from baseline to June 2002 in Humphrey visual field mean deviation, Humphrey visual field foveal sensitivity, Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity, refraction, and visual symptoms. For the medication and observation groups, LOCS III readings were similar for nuclear color, nuclear opalescence, and cortical opacification. There was a borderline higher mean grade for posterior subcapsular opacity in the medication group (0.43 +/- 0.6 SD) compared with the observation group (0.36 +/- 0.6 SD) (P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: We noted an increased rate of cataract extraction and cataract/filtering surgery in the medication group as well as a borderline higher grade of posterior subcapsular opacification in the medication group on LOCS III readings.

Research design and methods: Open-angle glaucoma patients not naive to prostaglandin therapy and currently controlled on p.m.-dosed (2100) latanoprost (n=21) or travoprost (n=30) had baseline IOPs measured at 0900. In a randomized, single-masked, crossover design, patients received travoprost (Travatany) or latanoprost (Xalatanz) at 0900 for 4 weeks, then were crossed over to receive the second prostaglandin for another 4 weeks. Treatment IOP was measured at 0900 prior to morning dose at both 4 and 8 week visits. Patient dosing preference (a.m./p.m.) was surveyed on exit. Main outcome measure: Intraocular pressure (IOP). Results: The mean IOP in the first period when all patients were dosed in the evening was assessed 12 h after dosing at 09:00 and it was similar in the two treatment groups (mean+/-standard deviation: 17.9+/-2.7 mmHg for travoprost versus 17.7+/-2.5 mmHg for latanoprost, p=0.812). In the a.m.-dosing crossover comparison, the 24-h post-dose IOP was significantly lower ( p < 0.001) on travoprost (16.9+/-3.1 mmHg) compared to latanoprost (18.6+/-3.3 mmHg).

METHODS: This was a randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, multinational and multicenter 12-week phase III study. Tafluprost 0.0015% (once daily: 20:10) or vehicle were administered as adjunctive therapy to timolol 0.5% (twice daily: 08:00 and 20:00) for 6 weeks, after which all patients received tafluprost for 6 weeks. Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were conducted at 08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 at baseline, and weeks 2, 4, 6, and 12. RESULTS: A total of 185 patients were randomized to tafluprost (n = 96) or vehicle (n = 89). Reductions in IOP were seen in both groups, which were consistently more pronounced with tafluprost. At week 6, the change from baseline in diurnal IOP ranged from -5.49 to -5.82 mmHg, and the overall treatment difference (tafluprost vehicle) was -1.49 mmHg (upper 95% confidence interval, -0.66; p<0.001, intention-to-treat population, repeated measurements of the analysis of covariance model). At week 12, the change from baseline ranged from -6.22 to -6.79 mmHg in the tafluprost group. Patients switched from vehicle to tafluprost achieved a similar decrease in IOP to those who received tafluprost throughout the study (group difference at 12 weeks, -0.09 mmHg, p=0.812). There were more ocular adverse events with tafluprost compared with vehicle (42% vs. 29%, respectively), but most were mild in severity. CONCLUSIONS: As adjunctive therapy to timolol, tafluprost achieved a consistently greater reduction in IOP compared with vehicle, and was well tolerated."

METHODS: 224 patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were recruited to a 3 month open labelled study. Previous glaucoma medications were washed out and the patients were randomised to receive either latanoprost 0.005% once daily or dorzolamide 2% three times daily. RESULTS: Of 224 patients 213 were included in the analysis of efficacy. After 3 months, latanoprost reduced mean baseline diurnal IOP from 27.2 (SD 3.0) mm Hg by 8.5 (3.3) mm Hg. The corresponding figures for dorzolamide were 27.2 (3.4) and 5.6 (2.6) mm Hg. The difference of 2.9 mm Hg (95% CI: 2.3-3.6) was highly significant (p<0.001, ANCOVA).

RESEARCH, DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-four patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with elevated IOP insufficiently responsive to monotherapy were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups: concomitant administration of travoprost 0.004% once daily and brinzolamide 0.1% twice daily (TB group: 22 patients) or latanoprost 0.005% plus timolol 0.5% once daily (LT group: 22 patients). Visits were undertaken at screening (current ocular hypotensive therapy was discontinued), baseline (randomization), and after 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months and 3 months of therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IOP was determined at 9 a.m., 12 p.m. and 4 p.m. at each study visit, and diurnal IOP was calculated as the mean of these recordings. Adverse events were recorded at each visit. RESULTS: IOP at the baseline visit was similar in both groups. Overall mean IOP was significantly lower in the TB as compared to the LT group after 1 month, 2 month and 3 month follow-up; only 9 a.m. measurements were significantly different, reaching a maximum difference (16.9 +/- 0.9 mmHg vs 18.4 +/- 1.8 mmHg, p  or = 30%) was higher in the TB group. Both treatments were well tolerated and there were no cases of withdrawal from treatment.

Interim results in 16 patients who have completed two years of follow-up indicate no significant difference between the timolol and placebo treatment groups with respect to the incidence of glaucomatous visual field defects. However, statistically significant increases in the horizontal cup/disk ratio and the area of pallor and a statistically significant decrease in the rim area/disk area ratio have occurred in placebo-treated eyes. No significant changes in pallor or in the topographic features of the optic disk have been detected in timolol-treated eyes. At the time of entry into the study, both study groups demonstrated a relatively high percentage of pallor, a feature that has been shown to be a sensitive and specific predictor of the future development of glaucomatous visual field defects. Thus, the findings of this investigation suggest that timolol treatment improves visual prognosis in high-risk patients with moderate ocular hypertension."

METHODS: In 2 identical, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, 1-year clinical trials, patients were treated with 0.03% bimatoprost once daily (QD) (n = 474), 0.03% bimatoprost twice daily (BID) (n = 483), or 0.5% timolol maleate BID (n = 241). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) at 8 AM, 10 AM, and 4 PM and safety variables (IOP was also measured at 8 PM at selected sites). RESULTS: Bimatoprost QD provided significantly lower mean IOP than timolol at every time of the day at each study visit (P<.001). This was also true for bimatoprost BID at most time points, but the efficacy was not as good as that of the QD regimen. At 10 AM (peak timolol effect) at month 12, the mean reduction in IOP from baseline was 7.6 mm Hg (30%) with bimatoprost and 5.3 mm Hg (21%) with timolol (P<.001). A significantly higher percentage of patients receiving bimatoprost QD (58%) than timolol (37%) achieved IOPs at or below 17 mm Hg (10 AM, month 12; P<.001). The most common adverse effect with bimatoprost was hyperemia (significantly higher with bimatoprost QD than timolol; P<.001).

METHODS: A new index, mean prognosis (MP), was designed for optimal combination of visual field thresholds, to discriminate between eyes that developed POAG from eyes that did not. Baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) in fellow eyes was used to construct measures of IOP asymmetry. Age-adjusted baseline thresholds were used to develop indicators of visual field asymmetry and summary measures of visual field defects. Marginal multivariate failure time models were constructed that relate the new index MP, IOP asymmetry, and visual field asymmetry to POAG onset for OHTS participants. RESULTS: The marginal multivariate failure time analysis showed that the MP index is significantly related to POAG onset (P < 0.0001) and appears to be a more highly significant predictor of POAG onset than either mean deviation (MD; P = 0.17) or pattern standard deviation (PSD; P = 0.046). A 1-mm Hg increase in IOP asymmetry between fellow eyes is associated with a 17% increase in risk for development of POAG. When threshold asymmetry between eyes existed, the eye with lower thresholds was at a 37% greater risk of development of POAG, and this feature was more predictive of POAG onset than the visual field index MD, though not as strong a predictor as PSD. CONCLUSIONS: The MP index, IOP asymmetry, and binocular test point asymmetry can assist in clinical evaluation of eyes at risk of development of POAG."

METHODS: Patients were randomized to TTFC administered in either the morning or evening for 8 weeks. Previously treated patients underwent an untreated washout period of 4-6 weeks, after which baseline IOP was required to be > 25 mm Hg and < 38 mmHg (in two readings taken at 10.00 +/- 1 hours). During the treatment period, IOP was measured at 10.00, 14.00, 18.00, 22.00, 02.00 and 06.00 hours. Patients were then treated with the opposite dosing regimen for 8 weeks and IOP measurements were repeated. RESULTS: In 32 subjects who completed the study, the untreated baseline IOP following washout was 27.7 +/- 3.5 mmHg. Both dosing regimens reduced IOP from baseline at each time-point and throughout the 24-hour diurnal curve (p < 0.0001). When treatments were compared directly, evening dosing (18.4 +/- 3.3 mmHg) provided a statistically significant lower 24-hour curve than morning dosing (19.2 +/- 3.5 mmHg; p = 0.001). Evening dosing also resulted in a lower 24-hour IOP fluctuation (3.8 +/- 1.6 mmHg) than morning dosing (5.1 +/- 1.6 mmHg; p = 0.0002) and lower peak IOP (p = 0.0003).

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy of brimonidine and dorzolamide as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers in adult patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. METHODS: In a prospective, investigator-masked, multicenter, parallel-design clinical trial, adult patients whose IOP was inadequately controlled with topical beta-blocker therapy were randomly assigned to receive brimonidine 0.2% twice daily or dorzolamide 2% 3 times daily as adjunctive therapy for 3 months. Efficacy was determined by the reduction in IOP from baseline. After 1 month of adjunctive treatment, patients who failed to meet a target 15% reduction in IOP at peak drug effect were crossed over to the other study medication. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were treated. Approximately 70% (74/106) of the patients were white, and 61.3% (65/106) had a diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma. Mean baseline IOP (ie, with beta-blocker monotherapy) was comparable between treatment groups (approximately 21 mm Hg). After 1 month of adjunctive treatment, the mean daily IOP reduction was significantly greater with brimonidine (4.40 mm Hg, 20.4%) than with dorzolamide (3.0 mm Hg, 14.4%, P = 0.033). At peak drug effect at month 1, the mean IOP reduction was significantly greater in the brimonidine group (5.95 mm Hg, 27.6%) than in the dorzolamide group (4.11 mm Hg, 19.7%; P = 0.007). Significantly more patients treated with brimonidine (44/51, 86.3%) than with dorzolamide (29/47, 61.7%) achieved the target 15% reduction in IOP at month 1 (P = 0.005). At month 3, the mean daily IOP reduction and the mean IOP reduction at peak drug effect were not significantly different in the 2 treatment groups. The mean daily IOP reduction was 4.98 mm Hg in the brimonidine group and 3.15 mm Hg in the dorzolamide group (P = 0.092). At peak drug effect, the mean IOP reduction was 6.39 mm Hg with brimonidine and 4.06 mm Hg with dorzolamide. The incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation was 9.3% (5/54) in the brimonidine group (depression, 2; allergic conjunctivitis, 1; dry mouth and tearing, 1; dermatitis, 1) and 9.8% (5/51) in the dorzolamide group (ocular burning and stinging, 2; ocular itch, 1; gastrointestinal complaints, 1; lack of tolerance for beta-blocker, 1), with no significant difference between groups. CONCLUSION: In this trial, brimonidine 0.2% twice daily produced greater mean decreases in IOP and was effective in more patients than dorzolamide 2% 3 times daily when used as adjunctive therapy to beta-blockers.

A 7 year prospective comparative study of three topical beta blockers in the management of primary open angle glaucoma	British Journal of Ophthalmology	Br.J.Ophthalmol.	2001	85	8	962	968	"AIM: To determine the long term efficacy of monotherapy with topically applied beta blocking agents and to determine whether selective beta blockers were able to preserve the visual field more effectively than non-selective agents. METHOD: A prospective randomised, open, comparative study of three topically applied beta blockers-timolol, betaxolol, and carteolol-was carried out on 153 patients (280 eyes) with newly diagnosed open angle glaucoma. Those patients who were not withdrawn were followed by the same observers for a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 7 years, with clinical observations, Goldmann tonometry and 24.2 Humphrey visual field analysis. RESULTS: All three drugs lowered the IOP significantly from untreated levels but betaxolol took up to 12 months in some instances to reach the maximum pressure reduction. After 7 years only 43% of the eyes begun on timolol, 34% of those started on carteolol, and 29% of those on betaxolol were still being treated with these medications alone. Visual fields were analysed throughout the trial by CPSD and MD and at the end by linear regression analysis (PROGRESSOR). The visual fields remained the same without apparent improvement or deterioration throughout the period of follow up. Eight patients (11 eyes) were withdrawn because of continuing field loss in spite of reduction in IOP (six using carteolol and five using betaxolol). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis shows that less than half the eyes initially treated with topical beta blockers might be expected to still be being treated with their original medication after 5 years. The rest required either additional medication or trabeculectomy. There was no statistically significant improvement or deterioration in the visual fields over a 7 year period. On the evidence of this trial there are no particular advantages in using selective beta blockers.

Latanoprost study group	Ophthalmology	Ophthalmology	1998	105	1	82	87	"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of latanoprost in the long-term treatment of glaucoma. DESIGN: The study was designed as a randomized, 6-month double-masked parallel group, multicenter study comparing latanoprost with timolol followed by an 18-month open-label, multicenter study in which all patients were treated with latanoprost. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 277 patients were treated with latanoprost for up to 24 months. INTERVENTION: For the first 6 months of treatment, latanoprost (0.005%) administered once daily was compared with timolol (0.5%) administered twice daily. Patients then received latanoprost (once daily) for an 18-month follow-up period regardless of their initial treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured over the 24-month treatment period, and any ocular-systemic symptoms or adverse events were evaluated. RESULTS: Latanoprost significantly reduced (P < 0.001) IOP by approximately 8 mmHg from pretreatment values, and this reduction was maintained over the 24-month treatment period with no sign of upward drift. Latanoprost is apparently free of any systemic side effect. The most significant ocular side effect with latanoprost was an increase in iris pigmentation, which occurred in 51 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Latanoprost, administered once daily, is effective and well tolerated for the long-term treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

"Objective: The European Glaucoma Prevention Study (EGPS) seeks to evaluate the efficacy of reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) by dorzolamide in preventing or delaying primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in patients affected by ocular hypertension (OHT). Design: Randomized, double-masked, controlled clinical trial. Participants: One thousand eighty-one patients (age, <30 years) were enrolled by 18 European centers. The patients fulfilled a series of inclusion criteria, including: IOP 22 to 29 mmHg; 2 normal and reliable visual fields (on the basis of mean deviation and corrected pattern standard deviation or corrected loss variance of standard 30/II Humphrey or Octopus perimetry); normal optic disc as determined by the Optic Disc Reading Center. Intervention: Patients were randomized to treatment with dorzolamide or placebo (the vehicle of dorzolamide). Main Outcome Measures: Efficacy end points were visual field, optic disc changes, or both. A visual field change during follow-up had to be confirmed by 2 further positive tests. Optic disc change was defined on the basis of the agreement of 2 of 3 independent observers evaluating optic disc stereo slides. The safety end point was an IOP of more than 35 mmHg on 2 consecutive examinations. Results: During the course of the study, the mean percent reduction in IOP in the dorzolamide group was 15% after 6 months and 22% after 5 years. Mean IOP declined by 9% after 6 months and by 19% after 5 years in the placebo group. At 60 months, the cumulative probability of converting to an efficacy end point was 13.4% in the dorzolamide group and 14.1% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-1.26; P = 0.45). The cumulative probability of developing an efficacy or a safety end point was 13.7% in the dorzolamide group and 16.4% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.51-1.06; P = 0.1). Results: Dorzolamide reduced IOP by 15% to 22% throughout the 5 years of the trial. However, the EGPS failed to detect a statistically significant difference between medical therapy and placebo in reducing the incidence of POAG among a large population of OHT patients at moderate risk for developing POAG, because placebo also significantly and consistently lowered IOP. copyright 2005 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology."

METHODS: A 12 week, double masked, randomised, crossover, multicentre study of patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and IOP controlled on ocular hypotensive treatment (mean < or =21 mmHg). Patients received either a once daily morning dose of the fixed combination of latanoprost 0.005% and timolol 0.5% or once daily evening latanoprost 0.005% and twice daily timolol 0.5% for six weeks and then switched to the other combination. The primary efficacy endpoint was the within-patient difference in diurnal IOP between fixed and unfixed treatment combinations after six weeks of treatment; a one sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI) for the mean difference in IOP <1.0 mmHg indicated the fixed combination was not inferior to the unfixed combination. Adverse events were recorded at each visit. RESULTS: In all, 190 patients were included in observed cases analyses (93 fixed to unfixed combination; 97 unfixed to fixed combination). Mean IOP at baseline was 16.9 mmHg in both groups. The mean diurnal IOP was 17.0 mmHg after fixed combination treatment and 15.9 mmHg after unfixed combination therapy (p<0.0001). The difference in mean within-patient diurnal IOP was 1.1 mmHg favouring the unfixed combination (95% CI 0.8 to 1.4 mmHg). Both treatments were tolerated well. CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, once daily administration of the fixed combination of latanoprost and timolol was found to be safe and effective.

METHODS: Eighty eyes of 40 subjects with POAG were included in the study. Subjects were randomly divided into four groups given timolol maleate 0.50%, betaxolol HCl 0.50%, carteolol 1% or levobunolol 0.50% drops, applied twice daily (one drug to each group). Before beginning the treatment and at the end of the first month ocular blood flow velocity was measured using the color Doppler imaging (CDI) method. In the ophthalmic artery (OA), central retinal artery (CRA) and temporal posterior ciliary artery (TPCA) the peak systolic (PS) and end-diastolic (ED) blood flow velocities were measured and resistive index (RI) values were calculated. The results within each group were analysed using the matched paired student's t-test. The data between groups was compared with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison tests. RESULTS: The timolol group showed a significant increase in RI values of TPCA. In the betaxolol group RI decreased significantly in CRA and TPCA, whereas in the carteolol group there was a significant decrease only in CRA. In the levobunolol group there was no change in any artery. CONCLUSIONS. Betaxolol seemed to have a greater vasodilator effect than carteolol, and levobunolol had no effect on the retinal and choroidal vasculature.

METHODS: This was a randomized, double-masked study with two parallel groups and a treatment period of 6 months. The primary objective of the study is to compare the IOP-reducing effect of lantanoprost with that of timolol at the end of the 6-month treatment period. A total of 294 patients were included: 149 were in the latanoprost group and 145 were in timolol group. Latanoprost was administered in the evening. RESULTS: Diurnal IOP (9:00 am, 1:00 pm, 5:00 pm) was reduced from 25.2 to 16.7 mmHg (33.7%) with lantanoprost and from 25.4 to 17.1 mmHg (32.7%) with timolol as determined at the end of the 6-month treatment period. No upward drift in IOP occurred with either drug during the treatment period. Latanoprost caused a somewhat more conjunctival hyperemia than timolol and more corneal punctuate epithelial erosions. However, both drugs were generally well tolerated. The most significant side effect of latanoprost was increased pigmentation of the iris which was observed in 15 patients (10.1%). Timolol caused more systemic side effects than latanoprost. CONCLUSIONS: Latanoprost 0.005% administered once daily in the evening reduced IOP at least as well as timolol 0.5% administered twice daily. Latanoprost was generally well tolerated systemically and in the eye. However, the drug has an unusual side effect of increasing the pigmentation of the iris, particularly in individuals with green-brown or blue-brown eyes.

METHODS: Twenty-five glaucoma or ocular hypertensive patients were treated with 0.5% aqueous and 0.1% hydrogel formulations of timolol using a randomised, double-masked, crossover, multicentre design. All the patients were subjected to passive head-up tilt, electrocardiography, exercise test and measurement of plasma concentration of timolol. In the analysis, the data on the two treatments were combined, and the Spearman correlation coefficients between the plasma level of timolol and physiological effects were calculated. RESULTS: During the head-up tilt test before rising the bed up, the resting heart rate (HR; R=-0.52, P=0.001) and PWV (R=-0.34, P=0.04) were inversely correlated with timolol level. In the upright position, ophthalmic timolol effectively suppressed the rise in HR (R=-0.36, P=0.03). The SI did not change with timolol concentration, while CI diminished as timolol concentration rose (R=-0.39, P=0.02). The SVRI correlated with timolol concentration (R=0.38, P=0.02). In the exercise test, correlation between HR and plasma level of timolol steadily grew stronger as the load increased, reaching R=-0.60 (P<0.0001) at the maximum load. Systolic and diastolic arterial pressures were not associated with the timolol concentration. CONCLUSION: The plasma concentration of ophthalmic timolol correlates with several haemodynamic effects.

Our purpose was to determine the effect of dorzolamide on intraocular pressure (IOP) when added to latanoprost (Xalatan(R); Pfizer Inc, New York, NY, USA) baseline treatment, and to evaluate potential efficacy differences between b.i.d. and t.i.d. dosing of dorzolamide. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomised, two-period crossover trial in ocular hypertensive or primary open-angle glaucoma patients (29 eyes in 15 patients) with an IOP of > 20 mmHg on latanoprost baseline treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to b.i.d. (08.00 and 20.00) or t.i.d. (08.00, 16.00 and 20.00) dosing of dorzolamide, treated in both eyes for 4 weeks, washed out for 3 weeks, then switched to the opposite dosing frequency for 4 weeks. Diurnal IOP measurements (every 2 hours from 08.00 to 20.00) were performed at baseline and at the end of treatment periods. RESULTS: The mean baseline IOP was 20.9+/-0.6 mmHg. After b.i.d. and t.i.d. dosing, the mean IOP was 17.7+/-0.6 mmHg (13.5% reduction) and 17.8+/-0.8 mmHg (16.5% reduction), respectively (both P<0.001 compared with baseline IOP). Diurnal IOP control was similar in the two groups, although mean IOP reduction was significantly lower at 18.00 on the t.i.d. regimen (4.7+/-3.3 mmHg) than with the b.i.d. regimen (2.3+/-2.7 mmHg, P=0.038). At other time points, no significant differences between the groups were observed. CONCLUSION: Dorzolamide 2% added to latanoprost 0.005% baseline treatment caused a significant decrease in IOP. The b.i.d. versus t.i.d. dosing of dorzolamide did not significantly affect a change in IOP except at one afternoon time point."

Latanoprost-induced stabilization of central visual function in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma	Journal of Ocular Pharmacology & Therapeutics	 	2008	24	2	224	229	"PURPOSE: Previous studies have demonstrated that visual function as measured by contrast sensitivity (CS) improves in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients following beta-blocker therapy and trabeculoplasty. There is evidence that ocular hypotensive agents, such as latanoprost, may provide benefit in terms of improved visual function, despite relatively small differences in the ocular hypotensive effect, when compared to other drugs. The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the effects of latanoprost and timolol maleate in Gelrite on CS. METHODS: Twenty (20) POAG patients on a monotherapy treatment regimen of topical beta blockade and with clinically stable intraocular pressure (IOP) were recruited for this single-masked, randomized, crossover study. Subjects were randomized to begin treatment with latanoprost 0.005% once-daily in the evening or timolol maleate 0.5% in Gelrite once-daily in the morning. At the end of a 3-month treatment period, each subject was crossed over to receive the alternative treatment for 3 months. Blood pressure, heart rate, IOP, and CS were assessed at baseline and after 4, 12, 16, and 24 weeks of treatment. Static central contrast sensitivity was evaluated at four spatial frequencies, 3, 6, 12, and 18 cycles/degree. Visual-field sensitivity was evaluated by using a commercially available program. Static threshold visual-field sensitivity was assessed at baseline and after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Subjects who were treated for 3 months with latanoprost, after being switched from timolol, experienced an improvement in CS at 3 cpd (P = 0.03). Conversely, subjects who were treated for 3 months with timolol, after being switched from latanoprost, demonstrated a significant loss in CS at 3 cpd (P = 0.04) and at 18 cpd (P = 0.03). Changes in CS occurred without a corresponding change in IOP, since there were no between-group differences (P > 0.05) at the end of each treatment phase. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with timolol maleate in Gelrite, latanoprost appears to significantly improve, or at least maintain, central visual function, as measured by CS, at different spatial frequencies in patients with POAG.

Methods: This was a double-masked, randomized, parallel group, multi-site study in subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Qualifying subjects, whose entry IOP was 22-36 mmHg at 8 AM on two separate eligibility visits, were randomized to receive either travoprost 0.004 %/timolol 0.5% in the morning (n=155) or timolol 0.5% in the morning plus travoprost 0.004% in the evening (n=151) or timolol 0.5% in the morning and evening (n=81). Mean IOP was measured at 8 AM, 10 AM, and 4 PM on the follow-up treatment visits at Week 2 and Week 6. Results: The fixed combination of travoprost 0.004 %/timolol 0.5% reduced IOP from baseline 29%-33% (-6.9 to 8.6 mmHg, p=<0.0001). Compared to concomitant administration of the components, the combination drop reduced diurnal mean IOP in a similar fashion, with differences in mean IOP ranging from 0.4 to 1.1 mmHg. Four of 6 time points showed significantly greater IOP reduction by concomitant administration. Not surprisingly, combination travoprost 0.004 %/timolol 0.5% produced statistically significantly greater IOP reductions than timolol alone at all time points (p<0.02). Conclusions: Combination travoprost 0.004 %/timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution was safe and effective in lowering IOP in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The combination drop offers the convenience of once daily dosing while maintaining IOP-lowering efficacy similar to concomitant administration of the individual components."

METHODS: In this double masked, multicentre, prospective, crossover comparison 33 subjects were randomised to brimonidine purite or dorzolamide for the first 4 week treatment period after a 4 week washout. Subjects began the opposite treatment for the second 4 week period after another 4 week washout. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at 08:00 (trough) and 10:00, 18:00, and 20:00 hours after dosing at each baseline and at the end of each treatment period. RESULTS: The baseline diurnal IOP was 22.9 (SD 2.8) for brimonidine purite and 22.2 (SD 2.4) mm Hg for dorzolamide. The trough IOP following 4 weeks of therapy was 21.0 (SD 3.7) for brimonidine purite and 21.0 (SD 3.1) mm Hg for dorzolamide (p = 0.90). The mean diurnal IOP was 19.3 (SD 3.1) for brimonidine purite and 19.8 (SD 2.4) mm Hg for dorzolamide (p = 0.46). Dorzolamide caused more ocular stinging upon instillation (n = 8) than brimonidine purite (n = 1) (p = 0.02). No statistical differences existed between groups for systemic adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that brimonidine purite and dorzolamide each given twice daily have similar efficacy in primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertensive subjects.

Methods: A randomized, double-masked placebo-controlled crossover study including 20 patients with ocular hypertension was carded out. Patients were randomized to treatment with the fixed combination of latanoprost and timolol or with placebo. The eyedrop was taken at 8 AM. After 2 weeks of treatment, the patients were hospitalized, and the IOP was measured at 8 AM, and thereafter every other hour until midnight, and also at 3 AM, 6 AM, and 8 AM. After a washout period of 4 weeks, they switched to the other eyedrop, and after 2 weeks of treatment were hospitalized and the IOP measurements were repeated at the same intervals. Results: The mean 24-hour IOP was 14.7 +/- 0.3 mm Hg (mean +/- standard error of the mean) for latanoprost and timolol and 19.4 +/- 0.3 mm Hg for placebo. This corresponds to a significant IOP difference of 4.7 +/- 0.4 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 3.8-5.8; P < 0.001) between the two treatments in favor of the combination. At all measured time points, except at 3 AM, the mean IOP was lower with latanoprost and timolol than with placebo. During daytime measurements the mean IOP was 13.9 +/- 0.7 mm Hg for the fixed combination and 19.5 +/- 0.7 mm Hg for the placebo. Corresponding figures at nighttime were 16.1 +/- 0.7 mm Hg and 19.2 +/- 0.7 mmHg, respectively. Conclusions: The fixed combination of latanoprost and timolol significantly reduced IOP after administration once daily for 2 weeks in patients with ocular hypertension. A reduction of IOP during a 24-hour period was seen, with a greater IOP reduction during daytime compared with nighttime. The fixed combination applied once daily could be a convenient alternative to concomitant therapy with its individual components."

Central corneal thickness in the European Glaucoma Prevention Study	Ophthalmology	Ophthalmology	2007	114	3	454	459	"PURPOSE: To measure central corneal thickness (CCT) within the participants of the European Glaucoma Prevention Study (EGPS). This study was designed to test if lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) by means of dorzolamide is able to prevent or delay conversion from ocular hypertension to glaucoma. DESIGN: Randomized, double-masked, controlled, observational clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred fifty-four of 1077 ocular hypertensive participants within the EGPS were investigated. Four hundred twenty-nine patients were treated with dorzolamide and 425 patients received placebo. INTERVENTION: Treatment with dorzolamide or placebo (the vehicle of dorzolamide) in 1 or both eyes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Central corneal thickness as measured by ultrasound pachymetry (DGH-500 Pachette; DGH Technologies, Exton, PA). The CCT measurements were obtained in the morning before measuring IOP. Five measurements were taken from each eye of each patient within 5 minutes of application of anesthetic eye drops. RESULTS: Mean CCT was 572.6+/-37.4 microm (range, 458.5-695.6 microm). The CCT was higher in younger patients, male patients, and diabetic patients. Mean CCTs for the 429 patients receiving dorzolamide were 574.2+/-38.48 microm (range, 458.5-695.6 microm) and 571.0+/-36.21 microm (469.7-690.1 microm) for the 425 patients receiving placebo (P = 0.205). Central corneal thickness did not correlate with refraction, baseline IOP, or systemic hypertension. CONCLUSION: Central corneal thickness measurements within the EGPS were greater than those reported in other studies of normal eyes without ocular hypertension. Larger CCT measurements correlated with male gender, younger age, and diabetes."

METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-masked, parallel group clinical study of 92 patients with open-angle glaucoma (with or without pseudoexfoliative or pigmentary glaucoma) or ocular hypertension. After a washout of existing glaucoma medications, patients were randomly assigned to receive one drop of travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% in the morning or evening for 6 weeks. The main outcome measures were mean intraocular pressure (IOP) assessed at 9 am, 11 am, and 4 pm, and safety variables. RESULTS: Travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution, dosed in the morning or evening, controlled IOP consistently throughout the day. Mean IOP ranged from 16.5 to 16.7 mmHg in the morning treatment group and from 16.1 to 17.2 mmHg in the evening treatment group. Travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution produced statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions in IOP from baseline; mean reductions ranged from approximately 8 to 10 mmHg (32% to 38%). Travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution was safe and well tolerated with the most frequently reported adverse event being ocular hyperemia, which occurred in 12.5% of patients in the morning treatment group and 13.6% of patients in the evening treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% given once daily, either in the morning or evening, is a safe and effective treatment for open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. It may be beneficial for patients judged to be inadequately controlled on a prostaglandin analogue or ophthalmic beta-blocker alone."

Length of use per 5-ml bottle	Ophthalmology	Ophthalmology	1994	101	10	1658	1661	"PURPOSE: The authors analyzed the actual length of use of commercially available 5-ml bottles of 0.5% timolol maleate (Timoptic) and 0.5% levobunolol (Betagan) among patients who routinely use topical beta-blockers (1 drop twice daily in both eyes) for glaucoma treatment. METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive two 5-ml bottles of either timolol or levobunolol in a double-blind fashion. The patients used the drops independently and the bottles in sequence. The dates were recorded when each of the two 5-ml bottles were used. Sixty patients were enrolled, 15 were excluded from the study, and the data from the remaining 45 were analyzed. RESULTS: There was a 21% greater length of use per 5-ml bottle among patients who were randomized to 0.5% timolol maleate (36.6 +/- 10.4 days) compared with 0.5% levobunolol (28.9 +/- 8.1 days) (P = 0.009). The length of use of the first bottle versus the second bottle was compared and was found not to be significantly different in either group. There was no statistical difference in intraocular pressure control among patients before and after the study. CONCLUSION: There is a markedly greater length of use of the 5-ml bottle of timolol compared with the 5-ml bottle of levobunolol. The difference is believed to be due to the configuration of the levobunolol's bottle tip and the vehicle used to deliver the drug. The data may be extrapolated to a substantial patient savings and should be considered in prescription recommendations.

Design: Post hoc analysis of prospectively collected data from a previously reported multicenter, investigator-masked, randomized clinical trial of bimatoprost and latanoprost. Methods: Patients were treated bilaterally with bimatoprost (n = 133) or latanoprost (n = 136) for six months. IOP measurements were taken at 8 am, 12 pm, and 4 pm at baseline, week 1, and months 1, 3, and 6. Long-term IOP fluctuation during treatment was determined as the standard deviation (SD) of all 12 follow-up measurements. Results: There was no significant between-group difference in short-term daily IOP fluctuation at baseline. Long-term IOP fluctuation over six months of treatment [mean SD (range SD)] was 1.9 (0.5 to 6.3) mm Hg with latanoprost vs 1.7 (0.5 to 3.9) mm Hg with bimatoprost (P = .050). Latanoprost-treated eyes were more likely than bimatoprost-treated eyes to have long-term IOP fluctuation of [greater-than or equal to]3 mm Hg (7.8% vs 2.5% of eyes; P = .009). Conclusions: Bimatoprost-treated eyes demonstrated less long-term fluctuation in IOP compared with latanoprost-treated eyes in this six-month study. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine their impact on glaucomatous progression. copyright 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

METHODS: Ninety-four eligible patients from an ongoing multicenter, interventional, double-masked clinical trial were followed through year 3, 48 receiving brimonidine 0.2% and 46 receiving timolol 0.5%. Study visits occurred at months 24, 27, 30, 33, and 36. The primary efficacy variable was mean reduction from baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) at trough. Visual acuity, visual fields, and safety variables (adverse events, ocular symptoms, heart rate, blood pressure, and laboratory test results) were monitored throughout the study. RESULTS: The 2 treatment groups were well matched, with no significant differences in demographic or clinical characteristics.

The overall mean reduction from baseline IOP at trough was 5.02 mm Hg with brimonidine and 5.57 mm Hg with timolol (P = 0.383). Brimonidine caused reductions in IOP at trough that were equivalent to those with timolol at months 30 and 36 (within the 95% CI). Visual fields were unchanged or improved in 95% of patients in both treatment groups. Both drug regimens appeared to be safe and were well tolerated. Ocular allergy occurred in 2 brimonidine-treated patients (4.2%). There were no statistically significant differences in adverse-event reports and no clinically significant effects on any ocular or systemic safety variable in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Brimonidine 0.2% BID continues to appear to be safe, well tolerated, and effective in the long-term management of ocular hypertension and glaucoma. Over 3 years, it provided sustained IOP-lowering efficacy and visual-field preservation equal to those with timolol 0.5% BID."

METHODS: The study was a double-masked, randomized, parallel group, multicenter, noninferiority design. Adult patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with qualifying intraocular pressure (IOP) on 2 eligibility visits received either travoprost 0.004% with BAC (n=346), or travoprost 0.004% without BAC (n=344) dosed once-daily each evening. Patients were followed for a period of 3 months. IOP measurements at 8 AM, 10 AM, and 4 PM were taken at study visits on week 2, week 6, and month 3. RESULTS: Mean IOP reductions, across all 9 study visits and times ranged from 7.3 to 8.5 mm Hg for travoprost 0.004% without BAC and from 7.4 to 8.4 mm Hg for travoprost 0.004% with BAC. Statistical equivalence was also demonstrated for the comparison of mean IOP changes; 95% confidence limits were within +/-0.8 mm Hg at 9 of 9 study visits and times in both the per protocol and intent-to-treat data sets. Adverse events and the number of patients discontinued owing to adverse events were similar for both treatment groups. Adverse events due to hyperemia occurred in 6.4% and 9.0% of patients treated with travoprost 0.004% without BAC and travoprost 0.004% with BAC, respectively.

METHODS: We conducted this three-month study as a multicentered, masked, parallel group comparison. Both the 0.25% and 0.5% concentrations were evaluated against similar concentrations of timolol maleate. Dosing was twice daily. An open-label, nine-month study followed the masked portion of the protocol, in which all patients received either 0.25% or 0.5% timolol hemihydrate. A total of 371 patients were included in both the 0.25% and 0.5% studies. RESULTS: We found statistically similar intraocular pressures with both the 0.25% (18.3 and 18.6 mm Hg for the hemihydrate and maleate groups, respectively) and 0.5% (19.9 and 19.5 mm Hg for the hemihydrate and maleate groups, respectively) concentrations of timolol hemihydrate and timolol maleate after three months of masked treatment. Likewise, peak intraocular effect at two hours after taking the medication was statistically similar between medicines at both concentrations. Likewise, both ocular and systemic safety were similar between the maleate and hemihydrate preparations at both concentrations. In the nine-month open-label protocol, therapeutic efficacy (19.9 and 19.1 mm Hg for the 0.25% and 0.5% concentrations, respectively) and safety of timolol hemihydrate were similar to effect and safety of the three-month protocol. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that timolol hemihydrate had an ocular hypotensive efficacy and safety profile statistically equivalent to that of timolol maleate for up to three months of therapy.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension (146 cases) were assigned randomly to the long-acting drug group (74 cases) and the currently-prescribed drug group (72 cases). Long-acting eye drops were instilled once a day in the morning (along with one drop of placebo at night), and currently-prescribed eye drops were instilled twice a day in the morning and at night. Eye drops were administered for 8 weeks. Intraocular pressure was monitored at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the initiation of drug instillation for evaluation of equivalence. RESULTS: Intraocular pressure was significantly reduced during the entire follow-up period in both groups. In the long-acting drug group, the reduction of intraocular pressure was--3.5 +/- 0.2,--4.3 +/- 0.2 and--4.6 +/- 0.3 mmHg at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, respectively (paired t test). In the currently-prescribed drug group, the reduction of intraocular pressure was--4.1 +/- 0.2,--4.4 +/- 0.3 and--4.6 +/- 0.2 mmHg at 2, 4, and 8 weeks(paired t test). The safety profile was similar in both groups, and the tolerance for the long-acting eye drops was as good as for the currently-prescribed eye drops. CONCLUSION: Because the efficacy of both drugs was equivalent, with an identical safety profile, the long-acting eye drops seem to be an efficacious formulation for clinical use in Japanese glaucoma patients."

The treatment period lasted 2 months. At the end of the comparative study, CBS 341A was evaluated in an open-label study during 1 year in the same patients. Seventy-two patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or high intraocular pressure were included in the study. Their intraocular pressure was >21 mm Hg while receiving beta-blocker eyedrops alone. After 15 days and 2 months of treatment with one of the three study treatments, intraocular pressure was measured at 12 noon and 7 p.m. Results and Conclusion: The three treatments reduced intraocular pressure similarly but there was a trend toward better intraocular pressure control with administration of the individual drugs as measured at 7 p.m. Mean reductions in intraocular pressure at 7 p.m. on day 60 were the following: 6.04 mm Hg in the CBS 341A group, 5.67 mm Hg in the timolol/pilocarpine group, and 7.90 mm Hg in the group with the individual drugs. Test medications were well tolerated apart from the usual and well-known effects of pilocarpine. At the end of the double-blind period, 70 patients received CBS 341A for 1 year. Intraocular pressure was measured at noon every 4 months. Fifty-three patients had controlled intraocular pressure with CBS 341A alone.

METHODS: Patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive fixed brimonidine/timolol BID (n = 385), brimonidine 0.2% TID (n = 382), or timolol 0.5% BID (n = 392) in a multicenter, double-masked study. The primary outcome measure was decrease from baseline IOP. RESULTS: Over all follow-up measurements, the mean decrease from baseline IOP ranged from 4.9 to 7.6 mmHg with brimonidine/timolol, from 3.1 to 5.5 mmHg with brimonidine, and from 4.3 to 6.2 mmHg with timolol.

DESIGN: Prospective single-center double-masked crossover comparison. METHODS: Patients who responded to timolol maleate 0.5% given twice daily were randomized to either evening or morning dosing of concomitant latanoprost 0.005% and timolol maleate 0.5% therapy for 7 weeks. Twenty-four hour diurnal curve intraocular pressure (IOP) testing was performed following each period. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients completed this study. There was a significant reduction at each time point in the 24-hour diurnal curve of both evening (17.1 +/- 2.7 mm Hg) and morning (17.3 +/- 3.1 mm Hg) dosed latanoprost/timolol maleate compared with timolol maleate given twice daily (21.1 +/- 3.3 mm Hg) (P <.0001). When the morning and evening dosing groups were compared directly, the 06:00 time point was statistically lower with evening dosing (16.4 +/- 2.3 mm Hg) vs morning dosing (17.9 +/- 2.8 mm Hg) (P =.01). Overall, a trend existed for greater daytime reduction with night-time dosing of the concomitant therapy, whereas morning dosing tended to give lower night-time pressures. There was a significantly lower mean range of diurnal pressure with evening (3.6 mm Hg) vs morning (4.3 mm Hg) dosing (P =.02). No differences in adverse events existed between the treated arms.

Methods: Patients received either the fixed combination of latanoprost and timolol once daily in the evening and a placebo in the morning and evening or the unfixed combination of latanoprost once daily in the evening and timolol in the morning and evening. Study visits were at weeks 2, 6, and 12. Main Outcome Measures: The primary efficacy end point was mean change from baseline to week 12 in diurnal IOP (mean IOPs of 8 am, 12 pm, and 4 pm). The fixed combination was considered noninferior to the unfixed combination if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference was <1.5 mmHg (analysis of covariance).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Randomized, parallel, double-masked, multicenter study. Patients with insufficiently controlled intraocular pressure (IOP > or = 22 mmHg) were randomized to DTFC (N = 117) or timolol (N = 115). IOP was measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks, with measurements taken at 6 p.m., 8 p.m., 10 p.m., 2 a.m., 6 a.m., 8 a.m., 10 a.m., and 2 p.m. ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT00108017 Main outcome measures: Statistically significant change in IOP from untreated baseline for DTFC at all hours at week 8. Secondary outcome measures included: IOP-lowering at week 6 at all individual time points, change from baseline to 8 weeks in mean daytime IOP (average of 8 a.m., 10 a.m., 2 p.m., 6 p.m., and 8 p.m. IOPs) and night-time IOP (10 p.m., 2 a.m., 6 a.m.), and comparison of DTFC with timolol after 8 weeks. RESULTS: Patients receiving DTFC had a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in IOP at week 8 compared with baseline at all eight time points (p < 0.001). Significant IOP reductions were also seen at all time points at week 6 (p < 0.001). DTFC significantly lowered mean daytime IOP and night-time IOP ( p < 0.001 for both). Timolol alone also significantly reduced IOP from baseline at 8 weeks for all diurnal time points, and mean daytime and night-time IOP ( p < 0.001 for all). Compared with timolol alone, there were significantly greater reductions with DTFC at 10 a. m. (p = 0.003) and 2 p. m. (p = 0.016), and for mean daytime IOP (p = 0.025) at 8 weeks. Significant between-treatment differences were not observed at other time points.

METHODS: Patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with normal blood pressure were randomized to LTFC, dosed each evening, or timolol dosed twice daily in a cross-over design for 8 weeks and the opposite medicine for 8 weeks. IOP was measured at 02:00, 06:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00 and 22:00 hours in the sitting position with Goldmann applanation tonometry and BP monitoring every 30 min while awake and every hour while asleep at the end of each 8-week treatment period. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients had a 24-hr baseline IOP of 26.3 +/- 2.5 mmHg, systolic BP (SBP) of 121.4 +/- 12.4 mmHg, diastolic BP (DBP) 72.9 +/- 7.1 mmHg, and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) of 33.9 +/- 5.7 mmHg. No statistical differences were found between untreated and treated 24-hr SBP, DBP, mean BP (MBP), heart rate, or nocturnal BP dipping status with either medication. LTFC lowered IOP more at each timepoint compared to timolol (difference between treatments 2.7 mmHg, p = 0.0002).

Using a worst and an average eye approach, mean initial intra-ocular pressures were 35.8 and 35.0 mm hg respectively. The mean fall in intra-ocular pressure after 4 weeks treatment ranged from 12.8 (0.1%) to 14.1 mm hg (0.6%) for average eyes (n = 56), and from 13.4 to 16.7 mm hg for worst eyes.

"Comparison of the effects of bimatoprost and timolol on intraocular pressure and pulsatile ocular blood flow in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma: a prospective, open-label, randomized, two-arm, parallel-group study"	 	"Current Therapeutic Research - Clinical and Experimental.65(6)(pp 444-454), 2004.Date of Publication: Nov 2004."	 	 	 	 	 	"Background: The current objective of antiglaucomatous therapy is to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP), and thus to preserve visual function. Many ophthalmologists believe this objective is best achieved by methods that improve ocular blood flow to the optic nerve head. Beta-blockers are effective ocular hypotensive agents, but they can reduce choroidal blood flow. Bimatoprost, a new prostamide analogue, has been shown to have a better IOP-lowering effect compared with the nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker timolol maleate, but little is known about its effects on the vascular bed of the eye. Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of bimatoprost and timolol on IOP and choroidal blood flow (as measured using pulsatile ocular blood flow [pOBF]) in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Methods: This prospective, open-label, randomized, 2-arm, parallel-group study was conducted at the Glaucoma Research Centre, Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital of Bari, Bari, Italy. Patients with POAG having well-controlled IOP (<16 mm Hg) on monotherapy with timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution (2 drops per affected eye BID) for <12 months but with a progressive decrease in pOBF during the same time period were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 treatment groups. One group continued monotherapy with timolol, 2 drops per affected eye BID. The other group was switched (without washout) to bimatoprost 0.3% ophthalmic solution (2 drops per affected eye QD [9 pm]). Treatment was given for 180 days. IOP and pOBF were assessed at the diagnostic visit (pre-timolol), baseline (day 0), and treatment days 15, 30, 60, 90, and 180. Primary adverse effects (AEs) (ie, conjunctival hyperemia, conjunctival papillae, stinging, burning, foreign body sensation, and pigmentation of periorbital skin) were monitored throughout the study. Results: Thirty-eight patients were enrolled (22 men, 16 women; mean [SD] age, 51.7 [4.8] years; 19 patients per treatment group; 38 eligible eyes). At 180-day follow-up in the timolol group, the IOP and the pOBF remained unchanged compared with baseline. In the bimatoprost group the IOP remained unchanged and the pOBF was decreased by 38.9% compared with baseline (P < 0.01). All AEs were mild to moderate and included conjunctival hyperemia and ocular itching (5 patients [26.3%] in the bimatoprost group) and pigmentation of periorbital skin (2 patients [40.0%] in the bimatoprost group). The incidence of each AE was higher in the bimatoprost group than in the timolol group (P = 0.008). Conclusions: In this population of patients with POAG, bimatoprost was associated with increased pOBF, and the reduction in pOBF associated with timolol was corrected after patients were switched to bimatoprost. Bimatoprost was associated with increased choroidal blood flow, beyond the levels recorded before timolol treatment. The decreased IOP level achieved in the timolol group seemed to be improved further by bimatoprost. Considering the potential efficacy of bimatoprost on IOP and pOBF, we suggest that this new drug may represent a clinical advance in the medical treatment of POAG.

Brimonidine tartrate 0.2% Twice daily vs timolol 0.5% Twice daily: 1- year results in glaucoma patients	American Journal of Ophthalmology	Am.J.Ophthalmol.	1999	 	1	20	26	"PURPOSE: To compare the long-term efficacy and safety of brimonidine 0.2% twice daily with timolol 0.5% twice daily in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. METHODS: Of the 926 patients enrolled in the study, 837 met the protocol entry criteria and received either brimonidine 0.2% twice daily (n = 466) or timolol 0.5% (n = 371) twice daily in each eye for 1 year. RESULTS: Brimonidine and timolol significantly reduced mean intraocular pressure (P <.001) from baseline levels at every scheduled follow-up visit, both at hour 2 (peak) and hour 12 (trough). At weeks 1 and 2 and months 3 and 12, significantly greater mean decreases in intraocular pressure (P <.040) at peak were observed in patients treated with brimonidine than those treated with timolol. The mean intraocular pressure decrease at trough was significantly greater for timolol than for brimonidine at each follow-up visit (P <.001). With the exception of ocular allergy (in 11.5% of patients using brimonidine and less than 1% using timolol), fewer than 3% of patients in either treatment group withdrew from the study prematurely as a result of a specific adverse event. Patients receiving timolol experienced significant decreases in heart rate (P <.001) from baseline at all follow-up visits. No significant changes in heart rate were seen in patients treated with brimonidine. Neither medication produced clinically significant changes in blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Brimonidine is safe and effective in the long- term lowering of intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, with efficacy comparable to that of timolol but without a notable negative chronotropic effect on the heart.

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, active-controlled, multicenter trial. METHODS: Patients comprised adult subjects (n = 403) of either gender with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in at least one eye. To qualify, the IOP had to be between 22 to 36 mm Hg in the same eye at two consecutive eligibility visits. The primary outcome variable was IOP measured with a Goldmann applanation tonometer. RESULTS: Mean IOP ranged from 16.2 to 17.4 mm Hg with the combination travoprost/timolol compared with 15.4 to 16.8 mm Hg in the concomitant travoprost + timolol group, from baselines of 23.1 to 25.6 mm Hg and 22.9 to 25.0 mm Hg, respectively. The fixed combination of travoprost/timolol significantly lowered IOP by 7 to 9 mm, similar to the IOP reductions observed with concomitant therapy. The most frequent ocular adverse event was hyperemia that occurred in 14.3% and 23.4% of subjects treated with travoprost/timolol combination and concomitant travoprost + timolol, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Travoprost/timolol combination produces greater IOP reductions than the positive control, timolol 0.5%, and reductions that were similar to concomitant travoprost + timolol. This study demonstrates that the fixed combination of travoprost/timolol produces significant and clinically relevant reductions of IOP in a once-daily dosing regimen.

"Background: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States and worldwide. Three to 6 million people in the United States are at increased risk for developing POAG because of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), or ocular hypertension. There is no consensus on the efficacy of medical treatment in delaying or preventing the onset of POAG in individuals with elevated IOP. Therefore, we designed a randomized clinical trial, the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study. Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of topical ocular hypotensive medication in delaying or preventing the onset of POAG. Methods: A total of 1636 participants with no evidence of glaucomatous damage, aged 40 to 80 years, and with an IOP between 24 mm Hg and 32 mm Hg in one eye and between 21 mm Hg and 32 mm Hg in the other eye were randomized to either observation or treatment with commercially available topical ocular hypotensive medication. The goal in the medication group was to reduce the IOP by 20% or more and to reach an IOP of 24 mm Hg or less. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was the development of reproducible visual field abnormality or reproducible optic disc deterioration attributed to POAG. Abnormalities were determined by masked certified readers at the reading centers, and attribution to POAG was decided by the masked Endpoint Committee. Results: During the course of the study, the mean+/-SD reduction in IOP in the medication group was 22.5%+/-9.9%. The IOP declined by 4.0%+/-11.6% in the observation group. At 60 months, the cumulative probability of developing POAG was 4.4% in the medication group and 9.5% in the observation group (hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.59; P<.0001). There was little evidence of increased systemic or ocular risk associated with ocular hypotensive medication. Conclusions: Topical ocular hypotensive medication was effective in delaying or preventing the onset of POAG in individuals with elevated IOP. Although this does not imply that all patients with borderline or elevated IOP should receive medication, clinicians should consider initiating treatment for individuals with ocular hypertension who are at moderate or high risk for developing POAG."

METHODS: After a 1-month washout period a baseline diurnal curve was measured every 2 hours from 08:00 hours (trough) to 20:00 hours in subjects with a trough intraocular pressure (IOP) and the pressure 24 mmHg. Qualified subjects were randomized to either brimonidine or unoprostone. After 6 weeks of treatment the period 1 diurnal curve was performed. Subjects were then switched to the opposite treatment for 6 weeks and the period 2 diurnal curve was performed. RESULTS: A total of 33 subjects were included in this study. In the brimonidine-treated group the trough IOP 20.1 +/- 2.8 mmHg was reduced from baseline up to 8 hours after dosing. In the unoprostone-treated group the trough IOP was 19.5 +/- 3.0 mmHg, which was statistically equal to that of brimonidine (p = 0.21), was reduced from baseline for 12 hours after dosing. Brimonidine decreased the IOP statistically more than unoprostone at 10:00 and 12:00 hours (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.02, respectively), while unoprostone reduced the IOP more than brimonidine at 18:00 and 20:00 hours (p = 0.002 and p = 0.05, respectively). Safety levels were similar between groups, but unoprostone caused more ocular stinging than brimonidine (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that twice daily brimonidine demonstrates a statistically greater peak reduction in IOP than unoprostone.

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of a once-daily evening dose of bimatoprost/timolol fixed combination (BTFC) with that of a once-daily evening dose of latanoprost/timolol fixed combination (LTFC) in patients not controlled with prostaglandins analogues monotherapy. Methods. A total of 82 patients on prostaglandin analogues monotherapy were enrolled in this prospective, multicenter, investigator masked, clinical study and were randomized to either BTFC (n=47) or LTFC (n=35) topical therapy once at night for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was to compare the mean daily intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction from baseline between the two treatment arms. Secondary endpoints included the mean daily IOP at 1 and 3 months compared to baseline and the percentage of patients showing a mean IOP reduction from baseline greater than or equal to 15% or 20%. Results. Mean IOP at baseline was 22.7+/-2.0 and 22.1+/-2.6 mmHg in the BTFC and LTFC groups, respectively (p=0.23). Both treatments were effective in reducing the IOP from baseline. The mean IOP reduction was significantly greater in the BTFC group than in the LTFC group (-21.4% vs -13.7%, p<0.001). A higher percentage of patients in the BTFC group showed a mean IOP reduction from baseline [greater-than or equal to] 15% (72.3% vs 40.0%) and [greater-than or equal to] 20% (61.7% vs 17.1%) compared to patients in the LTFC group.

METHODS: We prospectively randomized patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension to receive either timolol hemihydrate 0.5% solution or timolol maleate gel forming solution 0.5% every morning. The primary efficacy variable was the 8:00 AM trough intraocular pressure (IOP) 24 hours after administration. RESULTS: Three months after initiation of therapy, baseline IOP had decreased from 23.6 +/- 1.9 mmHg to 18.3 +/- 2.8 mmHg in the group taking timolol hemihydrate (n = 22) and from 23.7 +/- 2.2 mmHg to 18.4 +/- 3.1 mmHg in the group receiving timolol maleate gel (n = 21) at the 24-hour trough level. This was not a significant difference between groups at 3 months. Also, no difference was observed between groups in the 2-hour post instillation IOP. Visual acuity was decreased in the group receiving timolol maleate gel compared with those receiving timolol hemihydrate one minute after instillation of study medicine at month 3. Otherwise, ocular and systemic safety were similar between groups. No differences between groups in cardiac pulse or systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed.

Dorzolamide versus pilocarpine as adjunctive therapies to timolol: a comparison of patient preference and impact on daily life	Clinical therapeutics	Clin.Ther.	1996	 	5	821	832	"The purpose of this study was to compare 2% dorzolamide three times daily with 2% pilocarpine four times daily to determine patient preference, tolerability, and impact on daily life in patients concurrently receiving 0.5% timolol twice daily for treatment of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Seventy-five patients were enrolled in this 4-week, randomized, two-period, crossover study. The Comparison of Ophthalmic Medications for Tolerability questionnaire was used to assess patient preference and perception of side effects and activity limitations resulting from the study medications. IOP measurements were obtained 2 hours after drops were instilled and visual field tests were performed at baseline and at the end of each crossover period. Significantly more patients receiving pilocarpine than dorzolamide reported adverse experiences and discontinued the drug because of these adverse experiences. Similarly, patients reported more interference with their daily life because of side effects and activity limitations when receiving pilocarpine. Vision difficulties, accommodation difficulties, and brow ache were reported more often and were considered more bothersome by patients receiving pilocarpine. Bitter/unusual taste was reported more frequently and was considered more bothersome by patients receiving dorzolamide. Patients also reported missing fewer doses and were more satisfied with their medication when receiving dorzolamide. All of these changes were considered statistically significant. IOP control was not significantly different with either dorzolamide or pilocarpine. However, patients experienced a significant worsening of the mean defect of automated visual field examinations when receiving pilocarpine. At the end of the study, among patients with a preference, dorzolamide was preferred to pilocarpine by a ratio of more than 9:1. Overall, 81.9% of patients preferred dorzolamide. Thus dorzolamide demonstrated better tolerability and less adverse impact on daily life than pilocarpine."

Methods: This was a randomized, double-masked, multi-center, parallel, actively-controlled study with two treatment groups (travoprost 0.004%, n = 155; and latanoprost 0.005%, n = 147) for the first 6 weeks of treatment and one treatment group (travoprost 0.004%) open-label for weeks 6 to 12. Study medications were administered once-daily at 9 PM. All IOP measurements were taken at 5 PM (&plusmn; 1h; 19-21 hours post dose). The study was 12 weeks in duration with visits at screening, eligibility, weeks 1, 2, 4, 6 (masked phase), 8 and 12 (open-label phase). Adverse events were also monitored. Results: Masked phase: Mean IOP values were no significantly different at the eligibility visit (travoprost = 24.7 mmHg and latanoprost = 24.2 mmHg; P = 0.19). Mean IOP values were lower for travoprost at all time points during the first 6 weeks of the study (P > 0.05). Differences in mean IOP change from baseline for the four on-therapy visits all favored travoprost therapy. The difference in pooled IOP reductions from baseline was highly statistically significant (8.3 mmHg for travoprost and 7.5 mmHg for latanoprost; P = 0.0094) during the masked phase of the study. Both medications were safe and well tolerated. Open-label phase: Mean IOP levels remained constant in the travoprost pre-treated group (Week 6 16.1 mm, Week 12 16.2 mm) and improved from 16.4 to 16.1 mm in the group that was changed from latanoprost to travoprost. Conclusions: Travoprost 0.004% produced significantly greater IOP-lowering efficacy compared to latanoprost 0.005% at 5 PM which was approximately 20 hours after dosing."

METHODS: This was a randomised, double masked, parallel group, multicentre (14) study. After using timolol maleate 0.5% monotherapy twice a day for 2 weeks, patients (n = 146) with an early morning intraocular pressure (IOP) between 22 and 28 mm Hg, inclusively, received unoprostone isopropyl 0.15% (n = 50), brimonidine tartrate 0.2% (n = 48), or dorzolamide hydrochloride 2.0% (n = 48) twice daily as adjunctive therapy to timolol maleate 0.5% for another 12 weeks. Safety was based on comprehensive ophthalmic examinations, adverse events, and vital signs. Efficacy was based on mean change from baseline in the 8 hour diurnal IOP at week 12. Baseline was defined as values obtained after 2 weeks of timolol monotherapy. RESULTS: Each drug was safe and well tolerated. Burning/stinging was the most common treatment emergent adverse event. No clinically relevant changes from baseline were observed for any ophthalmic examination or vital signs. At week 12, each adjunctive therapy produced statistically significant (p<0.001) reductions from timolol treated baseline in the mean 8 hour diurnal IOP (-2.7 mm Hg, unoprostone; -2.8 mm Hg, brimonidine; -3.1 mm Hg, dorzolamide). The extent of IOP reduction did not differ significantly between unoprostone and either brimonidine (p = 0.154) or dorzolamide (p = 0.101). CONCLUSION: Unoprostone was safe and well tolerated and provided a clinically and statistically significant additional reduction in IOP when added to stable monotherapy with timolol. Furthermore, unoprostone was not significantly different from brimonidine and dorzolamide as adjunctive therapy to timolol."

METHODS: Qualified subjects were begun on timolol alone twice daily for 1 month and then randomized to either TLFC or brimonidine and timolol concomitant therapy for 6 weeks. Patients were then switched to the other treatment regimen. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were measured every 2 hours between 08 : 00 and 20 : 00 hours at baseline and at the end of periods 1 and 2. RESULTS: This study found that in 32 subjects the IOP diurnal curve on timolol alone (20.9 +/- 2.8 mmHg) decreased to 17.9 +/- 3.2 mmHg when patients were treated with TLFC and to 19.0 +/- 2.4 mmHg when patients were treated with brimonidine and timolol (p = 0.02). Intraocular pressures at individual time-points were statistically similar between the groups at the 08 : 00 trough and 2 and 4 hours after dosing. However, beyond 4 hours after dosing, TLFC-treated subjects demonstrated a trend towards lower IOPs at each 2-hour time-point that was not statistically significant after a Bonferroni correction (p <or= 0.05). The incidence of both solicited and unsolicited side-effects was similar between groups. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that TLFC given in the evening reduces the mean daytime diurnal IOP more than brimonidine and timolol given concomitantly twice daily.

The aim of this study was to determine whether topically applied brimonidine can influence blood hemodynamic characteristics associated with the perioptic short posterior ciliary arteries (SPCAs), central retinal artery (CRA), and choroidal vascular system in POAG patients. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial.In this prospective, institutional, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, randomized clinical trial, the intraocular pressure (IOP) and vascular dynamics of the SPCAs, CRA, and choroidal vascular system were analyzed in both eyes of 17 POAG patients, before and after treatment with 0.2% brimonidine for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Mean IOP reduction was significant (18.7%) following treatment with brimonidine. However, no clear changes were recorded with respect to blood perfusion parameters (peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, pulsatility, and resistance indices) associated with the SPCAs and CRA or the choroidal ocular pulse amplitude. CONCLUSIONS: Topical treatment of brimonidine to POAG patients causes a significant reduction of IOP, but blood hemodynamic properties associated with the SPCAs, CRA, and choroidal vascular systems appeared unaffected. Topically applied brimonidine, therefore, appears not to constrict or dilate peripapillary blood vessels.

The median intraocular pressure was consistently lower in the timolol group than in the betaxolol group (after four weeks of therapy, it was 20.2 mm Hg for timolol vs 22.5 mm Hg for betaxolol; P less than .04). Adjunctive therapy was required in eight patients in the betaxolol group compared to one in the timolol group (P less than .05). Betaxolol appears to be a clinically effective and safe agent in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma.

The primary variable was change from baseline in overall diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) at 4 weeks. Adverse events and other safety parameters were also analysed. RESULTS: Decreased IOP was clearly observed with both formulations at week 1 and was sustained until week 4. The overall treatment difference (preservative-free versus preserved formulations) at week 4 was 0.01 mmHg (95% confidence interval - 0.46 to 0.49; p = 0.96). There were no unexpected safety-related findings. Both formulations were well tolerated and most adverse events were ocular and mild in severity.

A subset of the betaxolol and timolol group were also followed with short-wave automated perimetry. One eye of each patient was used in the analysis. RESULTS: All three drugs reduced pressure effectively. Pilocarpine and timolol were not significantly different from each other and both produced a more marked pressure reduction than betaxolol. There were no significant differences between the drugs on the visual fields, contrast sensitivity, or motion detection. Betaxolol appeared to have a better impact on the blue-yellow sensitivity of the upper nasal and upper temporal visual field quadrants than timolol.

DESIGN: Randomized, double-masked, controlled clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand eighty-one patients (age, > or =30 years) were enrolled by 18 European centers. The patients fulfilled a series of inclusion criteria, including: IOP 22 to 29 mmHg; 2 normal and reliable visual fields (on the basis of mean deviation and corrected pattern standard deviation or corrected loss variance of standard 30/II Humphrey or Octopus perimetry); normal optic disc as determined by the Optic Disc Reading Center. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to treatment with dorzolamide or placebo (the vehicle of dorzolamide). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Efficacy end points were visual field, optic disc changes, or both. A visual field change during follow-up had to be confirmed by 2 further positive tests. Optic disc change was defined on the basis of the agreement of 2 of 3 independent observers evaluating optic disc stereo slides. The safety end point was an IOP of more than 35 mmHg on 2 consecutive examinations. RESULTS: During the course of the study, the mean percent reduction in IOP in the dorzolamide group was 15% after 6 months and 22% after 5 years. Mean IOP declined by 9% after 6 months and by 19% after 5 years in the placebo group. At 60 months, the cumulative probability of converting to an efficacy end point was 13.4% in the dorzolamide group and 14.1% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-1.26; P = 0.45).

CONCLUSIONS: Dorzolamide reduced IOP by 15% to 22% throughout the 5 years of the trial. However, the EGPS failed to detect a statistically significant difference between medical therapy and placebo in reducing the incidence of POAG among a large population of OHT patients at moderate risk for developing POAG, because placebo also significantly and consistently lowered IOP.

RESULTS: On the last day of treatment, mean 24-hour IOPs were 17.3+/-2.8 mmHg for latanoprost and 16.7+/-2.4 mmHg for bimatoprost (P = 0.01). The 6 pm individual time point for IOP was statistically lower for bimatoprost after a Bonferroni correction (P = 0.008). The largest IOP difference at any time point was 0.9 mmHg at 6 pm. The most common side effect was conjunctival hyperemia, which occurred less with latanoprost (n = 6) than with bimatoprost (n = 15) (P = 0.004). Two patients had their treatments discontinued while on bimatoprost, one due to conjunctival hyperemia and the other due to ocular intolerance. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the 24-hour diurnal IOP is statistically lower in POAG with bimatoprost, compared with latanoprost, among patients who tolerated bimatoprost. However, the IOP difference between groups was small and may not be clinically meaningful. In contrast, conjunctival hyperemia seems statistically greater with bimatoprost. The exact clinical importance of conjunctival hyperemia, if any, needs to be clarified further.

METHODS: A prospective, double-masked, active-controlled comparison in which qualified subjects had all glaucoma medicines discontinued for 1 month and then were randomized to either LTFC or brimonidine and latanoprost concomitant therapy for 6 weeks. They were then switched to the other treatment regimen. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at 0800, 1200, and 1600 h at baseline and at the end of Periods 1 and Period 2. RESULTS: In 32 subjects, the diurnal curve of the untreated IOP of 26.0+/-3.4 decreased to 17.8+/-2.5 on LTFC and 17.2+/-2.8 mmHg on brimonidine and latanoprost (P=0.31). At 0800 and 1600 h, the IOPs were statistically similar between the groups (P>0.05). At 1200 h the latanoprost and brimonidine treatment IOP was statistically lower (16.2+/-3.2) than LTFC (18.0+/-2.8 mmHg). However, the reduced IOP from untreated baseline was not statistically different at each time point and for the diurnal curve for each therapy (P0.05). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that LTFC and concomitant therapy of brimonidine and latanoprost provide statistically similar diurnal IOP reduction from an untreated baseline.

The intraocular pressure(IOP) changes and side effects on eyes and cardiovascular system were noticed. Data of visual field and ocular blood flow were compared with the baseline after given the eyedrops for 3 months. Results: After given one drop of the drug, intraocular pressure dropped significantly in both of the two groups. The IOP day curve at 1 month also dropped when compared with the baseline in both groups. There was no significant difference between the two drugs in magnitude of hypotensive effect after 3 months. And the higher the IOP was, the more the IOP dropped when using D-timolol. There were no serious side effects noted. No significant change of ocular blood flow was found by color doppler imagine.

METHODS: Fortynewly diagnosed glaucoma patients were enrolled in this prospective, observer-masked, randomized, parallel study. Patients received either latanoprost 0.005% or betaxolol 0.25% for a duration of 3 months. Baseline evaluation included intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement and cardiorespiratory examinations including pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements and spirometry. These measurements were repeated after 3 months. RESULTS: Both latanoprost and betaxolol reduced IOP significantly (p = 0.001). After 3 months of therapy, the mean pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure values of the betaxolol group were reduced (p = 0.027, p = 0.07 and p = 0.016, respectively). No significant changes occurred in the cardiovascular measurements of the latanoprost group (p > 0.05). There were no significant changes in any of the spirometric measurements tested for both groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both latanoprost and betaxolol are safe concerning respiratory functions. Betaxolol may cause small changes in the cardiovascular system, suggesting that blood pressure and pulse rates should be checked before and in regular intervals after prescribing it for the elderly.

METHODS: Of the 926 patients enrolled in the study, 837 met the protocol entry criteria and received either brimonidine 0.2% twice daily (n = 466) or timolol 0.5% (n = 371) twice daily in each eye for 1 year. RESULTS: Brimonidine and timolol significantly reduced mean intraocular pressure (P < .001) from baseline levels at every scheduled follow-up visit, both at hour 2 (peak) and hour 12 (trough). At weeks 1 and 2 and months 3 and 12, significantly greater mean decreases in intraocular pressure (P < .040) at peak were observed in patients treated with brimonidine than those treated with timolol. The mean intraocular pressure decrease at trough was significantly greater for timolol than for brimonidine at each follow-up visit (P < .001). With the exception of ocular allergy (in 11.5% of patients using brimonidine and less than 1% using timolol), fewer than 3% of patients in either treatment group withdrew from the study prematurely as a result of a specific adverse event. Patients receiving timolol experienced significant decreases in heart rate (P < .001) from baseline at all follow-up visits. No significant changes in heart rate were seen in patients treated with brimonidine. Neither medication produced clinically significant changes in blood pressure.

The efficacy of this formulation in short-term studies using once-daily dosing has been reported. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of 0.5% timolol maleate ophthalmic gel-forming solution (timolol GS) given once daily versus 0.5% timolol solution given twice daily in a long-term trial. METHODS: This was a multicenter, double-masked, 6-month trial. After a washout of ocular hypotensive medication, 286 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 0.5% timolol GS in both eyes once daily or 0.5% timolol solution in both eyes twice daily. All patients received a morning (9 AM) and evening (9 PM) dose. For patients in the timolol GS group, the evening dose consisted of a vehicle only, whereas for patients in the timolol solution group, both doses consisted of active drug. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at trough (before morning instillation) and peak (2 hours after instillation) at follow-up examinations at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24. Adverse events were monitored using patient reports. RESULTS: Of the 286 patients randomized, 191 received timolol GS and 95 received timolol solution. Ninety-three percent of patients (265/286) completed the study. At the end of the treatment interval (week 24), the mean decrease in IOP at trough ranged from 5.6 to 5.9 mm Hg in the timolol GS group and from 6.3 to 6.6 mm Hg in the timolol solution group. Similar efficacy was observed at 11 AM (peak). At week 24, the difference in mean IOP between treatments was -0.61 mm Hg (95% CI -1.44 to 0.22) at trough and -0.79 mm Hg (95% CI -1.77 to 0.20) at peak, indicating no significant difference between the 2 timolol formulations. The number of reports of blurred vision and tearing was significantly higher in the timolol GS group than in the timolol solution group (P = 0.04), whereas burning/stinging was reported more frequently in the timolol solution group than in the timolol GS group (P = 0.04). At week 12, the decrease in mean heart rate at trough (hour 0) was significantly less for patients in the timolol GS group than for those in the timolol solution group (-1.1 vs -4.2 bpm; P = 0.024). At week 24 (hour 0), the decrease in mean heart rate was less for patients treated with timolol GS by 2.5 bpm (P = 0.051). The heart rate data at peak (hour 2) was similar to that observed at trough at week 12 (-2.7 vs -5.7 bpm; P = 0.006) and week 24 (-3.1 vs -4.7 bpm; P = 0.063). The mean change in blood pressure was not significantly different between treatments. There were no clinically significant differences between the groups in visual acuity, biomicroscopy and ophthalmoscopy results, or visual fields.

Comparison of carteolol plasmatic levels after repeated instillations of long acting and regular formulations of carteolol 2 % in glaucomatous patients	IOVS	 	2004	45ARVO E-abstract 957	 	 	 	"Purpose: A new long acting (LA) formulation of carteolol 2% instilled once daily has been shown to provide a therapeutic effect similar to that of the regular formulation of carteolol 2% instilled twice daily. This study was intended to test whether the new formulation reduces the systemic delivery of carteolol. Methods: In this double-masked, randomised, intra-subject comparison study, 23 patients suffering from bilateral primary open angle glaucoma or bilateral ocular hypertension received successively, according to the randomised order of administration, each of the 2 following treatments: carteolol 2% LA once daily for 2 months and carteolol 2% regular twice daily for 2 months. Treatments were systematically instilled in both eyes. At the end of each period of treatment, blood samples were taken just before the last morning instillation (residual time), then 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours and 4 hours after this instillation in order to measure the carteolol plasma concentrations. Results: The mean values of maximal plasmatic concentration (Cmax), residual level and area under the curve obtained following carteolol 2% LA treatment were significantly inferior to the values obtained after carteolol 2% regular treatment (mean &plusmn; SD): Cmax (ng/ml): 1.72 &plusmn; 0.85 versus 3.64 &plusmn; 3.65; residual level (ng/ml): 0.70 &plusmn; 0.58 versus 1.80 &plusmn; 0.84; area under the curve (ng/ml x h): 5.50 &plusmn; 2.66 versus 10.27 &plusmn; 5.46. Both treatments appeared to be well tolerated. Conclusion: Whatever the eye-drops formulation, the plasmatic concentrations found are much lower (about 20 times) than those observed after oral administration of carteolol. According to the data of this study, it can be stated that the systemic delivery of carteolol is lower for the LA formulation than for the regular formulation. The LA formulation of carteolol eye-drops should so reduce the risk of í¢-blocking systemic side effects."

Interleukin-1beta tear concentration in glaucomatous and ocular hypertensive patients treated with preservative-free nonselective beta-blockers	American Journal of Ophthalmology	Am.J.Ophthalmol.	2005	139	1	72	77	"PURPOSE: To evaluate the ocular surface inflammatory response to the presence of preservatives in nonselective beta-blocker eyedrops. DESIGN: Prospective, crossover, single-masked, randomized clinical study. METHODS: study population: Twenty primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertensive patients were divided in two groups, one treated with preservative-free timolol 0.5% (group 1) and the other with preserved timolol 0.5% (group 2) eyedrops. After 60 days of therapy and 3 more weeks of washout, the two groups switched to the other therapy. procedure: At each visit, basal tear samples were collected from the inferior conjunctival fornix for the determination of interleukin (IL)-1beta tear concentrations by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Intraocular pressure measurement, conjunctival hyperemia, superficial punctate keratitis, and tear film breakup time were evaluated. main outcome measure: IL-1beta concentration in tears following the use of preserved eyedrops. RESULTS: IL-1beta tear concentrations increased significantly in both groups, compared with baseline values, during preserved timolol therapy. There were no statistically significant changes in hyperemia and superficial punctate keratitis throughout the study in either group. A statistically significant breakup time reduction was observed in both groups after 30 days and after 60 days of preserved therapy. CONCLUSION: The use of preservatives in timolol 0.5% eyedrops leads to tear film instability and ocular surface inflammatory changes documented by a reduction of breakup time and an increase of IL-1beta tear concentrations. Preservative-free beta-blockers are preferable for long-term hypotensive therapy to prevent ocular surface inflammation.

DESIGN: Three-month randomized, parallel-group, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, exfoliation glaucoma, or ocular hypertension with intraocular pressure (IOP) > 18 mmHg on monotherapy with travoprost (N = 163). METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive adjunctive therapy with twice-daily brimonidine (N = 79) or twice-daily brinzolamide (N = 84). Treatment efficacy was assessed after 1 and 3 months of combination therapy. Intraocular pressure was measured at 8 am, noon, and 4 pm at baseline (on travoprost monotherapy) and after 3 months of combination therapy. Mean diurnal IOP was defined as the average of the IOP measurements at these 3 time points. Adverse events were recorded at each visit. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Difference between treatment groups in mean diurnal IOP at month 3, adjusted for difference in baseline IOP, using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Mean diurnal IOPs (+/- standard error of the mean) at baseline were 21.7+/-0.33 mmHg in the brimonidine group and 21.1+/-0.29 mmHg in the brinzolamide group (P = 0.16). Mean diurnal IOPs at month 3 were 19.6+/-0.41 mmHg in the brimonidine group and 18.4+/-0.33 mm Hg in the brinzolamide group (P = 0.019). At month 3, mean diurnal IOPs, adjusted for difference in baseline IOP, were 19.3+/-0.27 in the brimonidine group and 18.6+/-0.25 in the brinzolamide group (P = 0.035).

Increase of retinal vessel width in ocular hypertensives with timolol therapy	"Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica, Supplement"	 	1995	73	215	41	53	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine whether timolol drops compared to placebo drops had a significant effect on retinal vessel width in ocular hypertensives. Methods: Thirty-seven ocular hypertensives were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5% timolol drops to both eyes for 18 to 24 months in a double masked clinical trial. Measurements of ocular pressure and retinal vessel width by computerized image analysis from fundus photographs were made at about 3 month intervals for 18 to 24 months of follow-up. Results: None of the subjects developed visual field loss when tested with the Goldmann perimeter by kinetic and static means at six month intervals. Subjects treated with the placebo showed no change in ocular pressure and a significant decrease in retinal vessel width over time especially in the right eye. Subjects treated with timolol had an increase in retinal vessel width compared to the placebo group significant especially for the superior temporal vein. Multivariate analyses indicated that the increase of retinal vessel width was not associated mainly with the ocular pressure on treatment or decrease in ocular pressure on treatment. Conclusion: Timolol treatment was associated with an increase of retinal vessel width. The effect of timolol appears to be related primarily to mechanisms other than the decrease in ocular pressure.

METHODS: This was a randomized, multicenter, double-masked, active-controlled, parallel group study. Three hundred sixteen patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomly assigned to travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution fixed combination once daily in the morning or concomitant administration of timolol 0.5% once daily in the morning and travoprost 0.004% ophthalmic solution once daily in the evening. The efficacy and safety of the fixed combination were compared with concomitant therapy over three months. The primary efficacy outcome measure was mean intraocular pressure. RESULTS: Both travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% fixed combination and the concomitant administration of travoprost 0.004% and timolol 0.5% produced statistically significant reductions from baseline in IOP, with mean IOP ranging from 15.2 to 16.5 mm Hg in the patients using travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% fixed combination compared with 14.7 to 16.1 mm Hg in the concomitant group. The upper 95.1% confidence limit for the differences in mean IOP (fixed combination minus concomitant) was < or =1.5 mm Hg at 7 of 9 visits, including all three 8 AM time points, 24-hours post-dose. Mean IOP reductions from baseline ranged from 7.4 to 9.4 mm Hg in the fixed combination group compared with 8.4 to 9.4 mm Hg with concomitant therapy. Safety analysis demonstrated equivalent safety between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: A fixed combination of travoprost 0.004% and timolol 0.5% produced clinically relevant IOP reductions in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension that were comparable to concomitant therapy with its components. Safety and tolerability of the fixed combination were also equivalent to concomitant therapy. Travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% fixed combination offers IOP reduction equivalent to concomitant therapy, with potential benefits that include convenience (fewer bottles and drops per day), improved compliance, cost savings (based on fewer co-payments), and elimination of potential washout effects.

They had been receiving timolol 0.5%, latanoprost 0.005% and dorzolamide 1% for at least 3 months. Randomly selected 25 eyes were additionally given bunazosin 0.01%, and the other 25 eyes served as control. They were followed up for 3 months. Findings: Baseline intraocular pressure (IOP) averaged 22.4 +/- 1.8 mmHg in bunazosin group and 22.2 +/- 2.0 mmHg in control group. IOP in bunazosin group decreased significantly by 1.4 +/- 2.1 mmHg (p = 0.0046) after 4 weeks and by 2.0 +/- 1.7 mmHg (p = 0.0008) after 12 weeks. IOP after 12 weeks also decreased significantly from IOP after 2 weeks (p = 0.0344). IOP in the control group showed no significant differences from the baseline throughout. Conclusion: Additional bunazosin induced significant IOP reductions after 4 to 12 weeks. Since the hypotensive effect was small after 2 weeks, more than 4 weeks are necessary to evaluate the full effect of additional bunazosin. Copyright Œ© 2009 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam.

METHODS: 27 eyes of 27 patients were consecutively randomized to receive preserved or unpreserved levobunolol; all patients had a recent diagnosis of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension and were not previously treated with topical medications. IVCM and impression cytology were performed before and after six months of therapy. Goblet cells density and a conjunctival epithelium regularity index were considered in the IVCM analysis, whereas impression cytology specimens were graded and scored in accordance with Nelson's method. RESULTS: After six months of therapy, IVCM and impression cytology parameters showed significant differences with respect to baseline in both groups (p<0.001); significant differences were also found between the two groups (p<0.001). The IVCM analysis showed a goblet cells density reduction (61% and 17% from baseline, respectively in group 1 and 2) (p<0.001) and an higher index of epithelial regularity (p<0.001) in both groups; the impression cytology analysis showed an higher score in both groups (p<0.001).

OBJECTIVE: This study compared the clinical success and quality-of-life impact of 4 weeks of treatment with brimonidine 0.2% BID compared with those of 4 weeks of treatment with betaxolol 0.25% suspension BID in patients with elevated IOP. METHODS: This was a multisite, double-masked, comparative clinical trial in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either brimonidine or betaxolol BID. Morning IOP was measured at baseline and at weeks 1 and 4 using Goldmann applanation. Efficacy was determined by reduction in IOP from baseline. Patients experiencing a > or =20% reduction in IOP were considered to have a successful IOP-lowering response. The Glaucoma Disability Index questionnaire was administered at week 4 to assess quality-of-life factors and the incidence of adverse events. Ophthalmic examinations were conducted at each visit. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-nine patients were randomized to treatment and completed the study, 81 receiving brimonidine and 78 receiving betaxolol. The majority were white (77.4%) and female (61.6%), and had a diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma (56.0%). After 4 weeks of treatment, both brimonidine and betaxolol effectively lowered IOP from baseline (mean IOP reductions: brimonidine, 5.96 mm Hg; betaxolol, 5.07 mm Hg; P = NS). However, a significantly higher percentage of brimonidine patients (52/81 [64.2%]) than betaxolol patients (37/78 [47.4%]) had a > or =20% reduction in IOP (P = 0.033). No serious adverse events were reported with either study medication. On the quality-of-life assessments, more betaxolol patients reported hyperemia (P = 0.011), and the reported hyperemia was significantly more severe in betaxolol patients (P = 0.009).

METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, doublemasked, active-controlled, parallel-group trial was conducted at 32 centers across Latin America. Patients aged > or =18 years with OAG or OH were randomly assigned to receive topical travoprost 0.004% or latanoprost 0.005% 1 drop QD (9 PM) for 6 weeks (masked phase). At 6 weeks, all patients were assigned to receive open-label travoprost 0.004% 1 drop QD (9 PM) for 6 additional weeks (open-label phase). Study visits were scheduled at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12. At each study visit, IOP was measured at 5 PM (+/-1 hour; approximately 20 hours after study drug administration). IOP changes from baseline were combined (pooled) from the 1-, 2-, 4-, and 6-week data to provide a comparison between the 2 treatment groups. Ocular adverse events (AEs) were monitored using slit-lamp examination. RESULTS: A total of 302 patients were enrolled (travoprost group, 155 patients; latanoprost group, 147 patients). The mean (SD) age of the travoprost group was 61.9 (10.6) years; 60.6% were female; and 47.1% were white. The mean (SD) age of the latanoprost group was 60.5 (12.4) years; 62.6% were female; and 49.0% were white. Mean IOP values were not significantly different between the travoprost and latanoprost groups at baseline (24.7 vs 24.2 mm Hg) or 6 weeks; however, the between-group difference in reductions from baseline in pooled IOP during the masked phase of the study was statistically significant (-8.3 vs -7.5 mm Hg; P = 0.009). At weeks 6 and 12, mean lOP levels were 16.1 and 16.2 mm Hg, respectively, in the travoprost group and 16.4 and 16.1 mm Hg in the group that was switched from latanoprost to travoprost (all, P = NS).

In addition, the effect of adding dorzolamide to the regimen of patients with inadequate ocular hypotensive efficacy while they were receiving one of the two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and the effect of adding timolol to the regimen of patients receiving dorzolamide were also evaluated. DESIGN: A double-masked, randomized, parallel comparison. SETTING: Multinational study at 34 international sites. PATIENTS: Five hundred twenty-three patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, 17 to 85 years of age. Patients currently using ocular hypotensive medications were required to undergo a washout. INTERVENTION: Two percent dorzolamide three times a day, 0.5% timolol (Timoptic, Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ) twice daily, and 0.5% betaxolol solution (Betoptic, Alcon, Fort Worth, Tex) twice daily.

METHODS: This multicenter prospective analysis included 92 patients (180 eyes) with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension on therapy beta-blockers and with intraocular pressure (IOP) greater than or equal to 18mmHg. The patients were randomly treated either with brimonidine 0.2% or dorzolamide 2% added for three months. Efficiency was determined by the reduction in 15% IOP from baseline at the first and the third month. RESULTS: Mean pre-treatment IOP was 22.37 DE 2.8 mmHg in the brimonidine group and 22.38 DE 2.6 mmHg in the dorzolamide group; mean post-treatment IOP decrease was 4.39 mmHg in the brimonidine group and 3.29 mmHg in the dorzolamide group. Clinical control at the first month was achieved in 78.3% and 71% of cases respectively (p=0.05). No statistical differences existed between groups for systemic adverse events. Four patients on brimonidine discontinued treatment due to local side effects. In the dorzolamide group, two patients left the treatment referring itching and three others left due to ocular allergy.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Randomized, parallel, double-masked, multicenter study. Patients with insufficiently controlled intraocular pressure (IOP > or = 22 mmHg) were randomized to DTFC (N = 117) or timolol (N = 115). IOP was measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks, with measurements taken at 6 p.m., 8 p.m., 10 p.m., 2 a.m., 6 a.m., 8 a.m., 10 a.m., and 2 p.m. ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT00108017 Main outcome measures: Statistically significant change in IOP from untreated baseline for DTFC at all hours at week 8. Secondary outcome measures included: IOP-lowering at week 6 at all individual time points, change from baseline to 8 weeks in mean daytime IOP (average of 8 a.m., 10 a.m., 2 p.m., 6 p.m., and 8 p.m. IOPs) and night-time IOP (10 p.m., 2 a.m., 6 a.m.), and comparison of DTFC with timolol after 8 weeks. RESULTS: Patients receiving DTFC had a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in IOP at week 8 compared with baseline at all eight time points (p < 0.001). Significant IOP reductions were also seen at all time points at week 6 (p < 0.001). DTFC significantly lowered mean daytime IOP and night-time IOP ( p < 0.001 for both). Timolol alone also significantly reduced IOP from baseline at 8 weeks for all diurnal time points, and mean daytime and night-time IOP ( p < 0.001 for all). Compared with timolol alone, there were significantly greater reductions with DTFC at 10 a. m. (p = 0.003) and 2 p. m. (p = 0.016), and for mean daytime IOP (p = 0.025) at 8 weeks. Significant between-treatment differences were not observed at other time points. Both treatments were well-tolerated, with no differences observed in the safety profiles between the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both DTFC and timolol provided significant IOP reduction over the entire 24-hour measurement period. Although this study was not designed or powered to compare DTFC and timolol, DTFC exhibited greater IOP-lowering than timolol during the daytime, but not at night."

METHODS: A prospective, observer-masked, crossover, active-controlled, randomized comparison in which after a 6-week medicine-free period, patients were randomized to either latanoprost-timolol-fixed combination therapy or latanoprost therapy, both dosed once each evening, alone for 8 weeks. Patients were then switched to the opposite treatment for 8 weeks. At the end of the washout and treatment periods, a 24-hour diurnal curve was performed. RESULTS: The baseline untreated mean +/- SD diurnal curve in 37 patients who completed the study was 24.2 +/- 2.0 mm Hg. The mean diurnal curve was 19.2 +/- 2.6 mm Hg for those who received latanoprost therapy alone and 16.7 +/- 2.1 mm Hg for those who received the fixed combination therapy (P<.001). The fixed combination therapy also provided a lower absolute intraocular pressure level (1.5-2.9 mm Hg, P<.001) and a greater intraocular pressure reduction from the untreated baseline (P<.001). Stinging was statistically lower with latanoprost therapy alone (P = .04), but itching was statistically increased compared with the fixed combination therapy (P = .04). CONCLUSION: The result of this study suggests that the latanoprost-timolol-fixed combination compared with latanoprost therapy alone provides improved intraocular pressure reduction over the 24-hour diurnal curve and for each individual time point in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma.

"Purpose: To compare the 24-hour efficacy of dorzolamide and timolol maleate administered twice daily to primary open-angle glaucoma patients whose intraocular pressure (IOP) could not be adequately controlled with latanoprost monotherapy. Methods: In this double-blind prospective crossover clinical comparison trial, 36 primary open-angle glaucoma patients with uncontrolled IOP despite treatment with latanoprost applied once daily were administered timolol and dorzolamide twice daily. The treatment sequence was randomized. All patients underwent measurements for four 24-hour tonometric curves: at baseline and after each 4-week period of treatment. The IOP measurements were taken at 06:00, 09:00, 12:00, 15:00, 18:00, 21:00, 24:00 and 03:00 h. The between-group differences were tested for significance by means of parametric analysis of variance at each time point and circadian curve. The peak values within circadian curve were defined. The mean of the exact amount and percentage of additional IOP reductions from baseline were evaluated and success rates (a minimum of 10% reduction) were determined for both drug regimens. Results: The mean peak/circadian curve IOPs were 23.4 +/- 2.2/21.8 +/- 2.2 mm Hg at dorzolamide baseline, 23.3 +/- 2.2/21.7 +/- 2.1 mm Hg at timolol baseline, and reduced to 20.2 +/- 1.7/18.7 +/- 1.7 mm Hg and 20.7 +/- 2.4/19.4 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, respectively. When added to latanoprost, both dorzolamide and timolol lowered IOP at circadian curve significantly (p 2 test). Conclusion: Both of the combinations are effective in lowering IOP, the exact amount and percentage of reduction is greater with the latanoprost + dorzolamide regimen, especially at night-time.

METHODS: A 6-month randomized, double-masked, multicenter study with three parallel groups was undertaken. Two hundred sixty-seven patients were randomized, 84 to timolol, 89 to latanoprost in the morning for 3 months and then in the evening for another 3 months, and 94 to latanoprost with the treatment schedule reversed. RESULTS: After 6 months, timolol reduced diurnal IOP from 24.6 to 17.9 mmHg (27%); latanoprost applied in the morning, from 25.5 to 17.7 mmHg (31%); and latanoprost applied in the evening, from 24.8 to 16.2 mmHg (35%). The efficacy of latanoprost applied in the evening was statistically superior to latanoprost applied in the morning and to timolol (P < 0.001). Latanoprost induced a slight increase in conjunctival hyperemia in 31.4% of treated patients, compared with 15.9% for timolol. Sporadic episodes of mild punctate corneal epithelial erosions were three times as frequent in latanoprost-treated eyes as in timolol-treated eyes. The most significant ocular side effect was increased pigmentation of the iris observed in five and suspected in seven more latanoprost-treated eyes. All these eyes had a mixed green-brown or blue/gray-brown iris color. Timolol reduced heart rate by 3 beats/minute (P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The effect on diurnal IOP of latanoprost applied once daily in the evening is superior to that of timolol. The main difference in side effects is increased pigmentation of the iris induced by latanoprost, most likely due to stimulation of melanogenesis in iris stromal melanocytes.

METHODS: An open label randomised clinical trial was conducted, which included 18 glaucomatous patients (36 eyes). In the first 4 weeks, latanoprost 0.005% was prescribed for both eyes of the patients and any other antiglaucoma medication was discontinued. In the next 4 weeks (phase 1), bimatoprost 0.03% was combined with latanoprost in one randomly assigned eye (case eye) of each patient. In the next 4 weeks (phase 2), bimatoprost was discontinued in the case eyes, while bimatoprost was substituted for latanoprost in the fellow eye (control eye). The IOP was measured at the end of the first 4 weeks (baseline measurement) and weekly during phases 1 and 2. RESULTS: In the case eyes, the mean IOP increased along the first phase (1.8 mm Hg; p = 0.006) when compared to baseline measurements. The IOP returned to previous values after discontinuation of bimatoprost in phase 2. In the control eyes, the mean IOP did not change throughout the study.

METHODS: This was a randomized, double-masked, multicenter, parallel-group, active-controlled study. Adult subjects with open-angle glaucoma (with or without pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion component) or ocular hypertension were eligible to participate if their IOP was inadequately controlled with > or =4 weeks of beta-blocker monotherapy, as indicated by IOP of 22 to 36 mm Hg at 9 AM at screening. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive placebo + travoprost or latanoprost/timolol + placebo. Patients in the travoprost group administered travoprost at 9 PM and placebo at 9 AM; patients in the latanoprost/timolol group administered latanoprost/timolol at 9 AM and placebo at 9 PM. IOP measurements were performed using Goldmann applanation tonometry at 9 AM and 5 PM at the week-2 and week-6 visits. Both volunteered and elicited reports of adverse events were collected; all patients who were randomized and received > or =1 dose of study drug were included in the safety analysis. RESULTS: One hundred ten patients were randomized, of whom 106 patients were evaluable (travoprost, n = 50; latanoprost/timolol, n = 56). There were no statistically significant differences at baseline between the treatment groups, based on age group, sex, race, iris color, or diagnosis. Mean IOP values were not statistically different between groups at baseline or during treatment. In the pooled results for 9 Am assessment at weeks 2 and 6, mean (SEM) IOP reductions for travoprost and latanoprost/timolol were 7.0 (0.5) and 6.4 (0.5) mm Hg, respectively (P = NS).

"The purpose of this study was to compare 2% dorzolamide three times daily with 2% pilocarpine four times daily to determine patient preference, tolerability, and impact on daily life in patients concurrently receiving 0.5% timolol twice daily for treatment of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Seventy-five patients were enrolled in this 4-week, randomized, two-period, crossover study. The Comparison of Ophthalmic Medications for Tolerability questionnaire was used to assess patient preference and perception of side effects and activity limitations resulting from the study medications. IOP measurements were obtained 2 hours after drops were instilled and visual field tests were performed at baseline and at the end of each crossover period. Significantly more patients receiving pilocarpine than dorzolamide reported adverse experiences and discontinued the drug because of these adverse experiences. Similarly, patients reported more interference with their daily life because of side effects and activity limitations when receiving pilocarpine. Vision difficulties, accommodation difficulties, and brow ache were reported more often and were considered more bothersome by patients receiving pilocarpine. Bitter/unusual taste was reported more frequently and was considered more bothersome by patients receiving dorzolamide. Patients also reported missing fewer doses and were more satisfied with their medication when receiving dorzolamide. All of these changes were considered statistically significant. IOP control was not significantly different with either dorzolamide or pilocarpine. However, patients experienced a significant worsening of the mean defect of automated visual field examinations when receiving pilocarpine. At the end of the study, among patients with a preference, dorzolamide was preferred to pilocarpine by a ratio of more than 9:1. Overall, 81.9% of patients preferred dorzolamide. Thus dorzolamide demonstrated better tolerability and less adverse impact on daily life than pilocarpine."

The 62 patients who entered this study were instructed to instill a timolol ophthalmic solution twice daily in one eye and a placebo solution in the other eye. Perimetry was conducted at four-month intervals, and stereo-optic disk photographs were obtained yearly. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was reduced by a mean of 4.9 +/- 3.3 mm Hg in the timolol-treated eyes. IOP in the contralateral placebo-treated eye was reduced by approximately half this amount. During the five-year follow-up period, visual field loss developed in 10 placebo-treated eyes and four of the eyes treated with timolol. Progressive cupping was detected in eight eyes treated with placebo and four eyes with timolol. In addition, a significantly greater increase in optic disk pallor was noted in placebo-treated eyes. The results of this long-term follow-up study indicate that lowering IOP with timolol treatment prevents or delays the onset of glaucomatous damage in patients with ocular hypertension considered to be at moderate risk of developing open-angle glaucoma.

"Objective: To assess the effects of dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination (DTFC) and latanoprost 0.005% on the retrobulbar haemodynamics and intraocular pressure (IOP) of open-angle glaucoma patients. Methods: 22 consecutive subjects with newly diagnosed, open-angle glaucoma were included in this prospective, examiner masked, randomized, crossover study. The patients were randomized into two different arms. Peak systolic velocity (PSV), enddiastolic velocity (EDV), Pourcelot's resistance index (RI) and intraocular pressure (IOP) were determined at baseline and after 1 month of medical treatment with DTFC or latanoprost 0.005% in both groups. A 4-week washout period, without medical treatment, between study arms was carried out. Primary efficacy variables were the PSV, EDV and RI in the ophthalmic artery (OA) and short posterior ciliary artery (SPCA) and intraocular pressure (IOP). Inter- and intra-group comparisons were performed with a one-way ANOVA test and two-tailed paired Student's t-test respectively. Results: Intraocular pressure (IOP) and colour Doppler imaging (GDI) measurements were similar at baseline. Compared to baseline and washout measurements, only the fixed combination dorzolamide/timolol significantly increased the EDV in the OA and in the SPCA, p = 0.00012 and p = 0.00012, respectively and decreased the resistance index in the ophthalmic and short posterior ciliary arteries, p = 0.00011 and p = 0.00031, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in the IOP lowering effect of either treatment. Conclusion: Over a treatment period of 1 month, only the fixed combination dorzolamide/timolol seems to have a vascular effect on retrobulbar vessels.

METHODS: In prospective randomized fashion, we evaluated the ocular hypotensive effect and safety of brinzolamide or timolol in 1 eye of 32 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, normal-tension glaucoma, or ocular hypertension who had been treated with latanoprost for more than 1 month. Intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure, and pulse were measured before and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Corneal endothelial cell density was measured at baseline and at 12 weeks. RESULTS: The IOP was 17.8+/-1.7 mm Hg (mean+/-SD) before the addition of brinzolamide (n=15) and 15.7+/-2.1 mm Hg at 12 weeks (P<0.01). In comparison, the IOP was 18.5+/-3.7 mm Hg before the addition of timolol (n=15) and 15.8+/-3.2 mm Hg at 12 weeks (P<0.01). Both brinzolamide and timolol significantly decreased IOP at 12 weeks, by a mean of 2.0 mm Hg and mean 2.7 mm Hg, respectively, and were more effective than latanoprost alone (P<0.01), but there were no significant differences between the drugs and no significant differences in corneal endothelial cell density and blood pressure before and after addition of either drug. At 12 weeks, pulse was decreased in patients receiving timolol (P<0.01). As systemic adverse events, there was one instance of malar flushing after brinzolamide addition and episodes of chest discomfort after timolol addition in 1 patient.

Because these agents may be absorbed systemically, their use is of concern in patients with restricted pulmonary function. We compared the efficacy of betaxolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, and dipivefrin, an alpha/beta-adrenergic agonist. Seventy-six patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomly assigned to receive either betaxolol 0.5% or dipivefrin 0.1%. Patients were examined at two weeks, one month, two months, and three months. Intraocular pressure reductions were similar, with a mean decrease of 4.1 mm Hg in the betaxolol group and 3.5 mm Hg in the dipivefrin group. Both treatments caused similar minor increases in heart rate, typical with alpha-adrenergic agonists but atypical with beta-blockers.

Predictive factors for open-angle glaucoma among patients with ocular hypertension in the european glaucoma prevention study	Ophthalmology	Ophthalmology	2007	114	1	3	9	"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the predictive factors of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) in patients affected by ocular hypertension enrolled in the European Glaucoma Prevention Study (EGPS). DESIGN: Randomized, double-masked, controlled clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand seventy-seven patients, > or =30 years old, were enrolled at 18 European centers. The patients met inclusion criteria: intraocular pressure, 22 to 29 mmHg; 2 normal and reliable visual fields (VFs) (on the basis of mean deviation and corrected pattern standard deviation [PSD]); and a normal optic disc, as determined by an optic disc reading center. INTERVENTION: Treatment with dorzolamide or a placebo (the vehicle of dorzolamide) in one or both eyes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Efficacy end points were VF and/or optic disc changes. Baseline demographic and clinical data were collected before randomization, except for corneal thickness measurements, which were determined during follow-up. Proportional hazards models were used to identify factors that predicted which participants in the EGPS had developed OAG. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, factors that predicted the development of OAG included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.69), larger vertical cup-to-disc (C/D) ratio (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.14-1.58), larger vertical C/D ratio asymmetry (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.11-1.93), higher PSD (HR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.15-2.38), and lesser central corneal thickness (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.05-1.67). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline age, vertical C/D ratio, vertical C/D ratio asymmetry, and PSD were good predictors of the onset of OAG in the EGPS. Central corneal thickness was found to be a powerful predictor of the development of OAG. The EGPS results agree with the findings of the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study and support the need for a thorough evaluation of patients with ocular hypertension.

METHODS: A multicenter, double-masked, prospective, parallel-group study was conducted to compare brinzolamide 1.0%, administered two and three times a day, dorzolamide 2.0% three times a day, and timolol 0.5% twice a day in 572 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The primary end point was diurnally corrected intraocular pressure reduction from baseline, evaluated at both peak and trough times during a 3-month period. RESULTS: Mean intraocular pressure changes after twice daily (-3.8 to -5.7 mm Hg) and three times daily (-4.2 to -5.6 mm Hg) dosing with brinzolamide 1.0% were statistically equivalent (confidence limit  or = 5 mm Hg or intraocular pressure < or = 21 mm Hg) were observed in up to 75.7% of patients taking brinzolamide twice daily and in up to 80.1% taking brinzolamide three times daily. Treatment with brinzolamide 1.0% was safe, comfortable, and well tolerated. The incidence of ocular discomfort (burning and stinging) on instillation of brinzolamide (twice daily, 1.8%; three times daily, 3.0%) was significantly less (P = .000) compared with treatment with dorzolamide (16.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Brinzolamide 1.0% produced clinically relevant intraocular pressure reductions in substantial numbers of patients.

Design: Randomized, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial. Participants: Two hundred patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Methods: Included were patients who were controlled (IOP < 21 mmHg) on the nonfixed combination of latanoprost and timolol for at least 3 months before the baseline visit or patients on monotherapy with either latanoprost or timolol who were eligible for dual therapy not being fully controlled on monotherapy. The latter group of patients underwent a 6-week wash-in phase with the nonfixed combination of latanoprost and timolol before baseline IOP determination and study inclusion. Supine and sitting position IOPs were recorded at 8 pm, midnight, 5 am, 8 am, noon, and 4 pm at baseline, week 6, and week 12 visits. Main Outcome Measure: An analysis of covariance model was used for a noninferiority test of the primary efficacy variable, with mean area under the 24-hour IOP curve after 12 weeks of treatment as response variable and treatment, center, and baseline IOP as factors. A secondary analysis was performed on the within-treatment change from baseline. Results: Mean baseline IOPs were 16.3+/-3.3 mmHg and 15.5+/-2.9.mmHg in the bimatoprost and LTFC groups, respectively. At week 12, mean IOPs were 16.1+/-2.5 mmHg for the bimatoprost group and 16.3+/-3.7 mmHg for the LTFC group, and no significant difference between the 2 treatment groups could be found. As compared with baseline, mean IOP increased by 0.3+/-3.6 mmHg during the day and decreased by 0.8+/-3.8 mmHg during the night in the bimatoprost group, whereas there were increases of 1.43+/-2.6 mmHg and 0.14+/-3.2 mmHg in the LTFC group, respectively. Conclusions: Bimatoprost is not inferior to the LTFC in maintaining IOP at a controlled level during a 24-hour period in patients switched from the nonfixed combination of latanoprost and timolol. copyright 2007 American Academy of Ophthalmology."

METHODS: This was a randomized, double-masked, multicenter, parallel group, active-controlled study conducted at 41 sites. At the eligibility visit the patients were randomized (1:1) to the assigned masked medication if they met inclusion/exclusion criteria, and the mean IOP values in the eligible eyes were > or =24 mmHg at 9 AM and > or =21 mmHg at 11 AM and 4 PM. Patients were excluded if the mean IOP in either eye was >36 mmHg. Patients were instructed to administer the assigned medication each morning at 9 AM. During the treatment phase of the study, IOP was measured at 9 AM at week 2, week 6, month 3, and month 9. At the month 6 and month 12 visits, IOP was measured at 9 AM, 11 AM, and 4 PM. Statistical methods included a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA); to test for noninferiority, a 95% confidence interval for the treatment group difference was constructed based on the ANOVA results for each time point at month 12. RESULTS: Patients (n=408) with OAG or OH were enrolled at 41 sites. One patient withdrew prior to receiving medication so 207 in the Trav/Tim group and 200 in the Lat/Tim group were evaluable for safety. Baseline demographic characteristics as well as IOP values showed no statistical differences between the two groups. Trav/Tim provided lower mean IOP values than Lat/Tim that were statistically significant at the week 2 9 AM (p=0.0081), month 6 9 AM (p=0.0056), and month 6 11 AM (p=0.0128) time points and at 9 AM time point pooled across all visits (p=0.0235) when mean IOP was 0.6 mmHg lower in the Trav/Tim group. Treatment-related adverse events were mild in both groups. Although hyperemia was reported from a higher percentage of patients in Trav/Tim group, differences in average hyperemia scores between the two groups were not considered clinically relevant. CONCLUSIONS: Travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution produced mean IOP levels that are statistically noninferior to latanoprost 0.005%/timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution. Furthermore, at 9:00 AM, 24 hours after dosing, IOP was statistically lower for travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% pooled across all visits.

"Long-term effects of timolol therapy in ocular hypertension: A double-masked, randomised trial"	Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology	 	2000	238	11	877	883	"Background: Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) has been shown to be one of the most important risk factors for developing glaucoma. Yet it has not been clearly demonstrated that IOP-lowering treatment can reduce the incidence of glaucoma damage in patients with ocular hypertension. The aim of the current paper was to report the results of a long-term study addressing this very problem. Methods: We conducted a randomised, double-masked study comparing timolol and placebo treatment in 90 patients with ocular hypertension plus some additional risk factor. Patients were followed at 3-month intervals prospectively for 10 years or until glaucomatous field loss could be demonstrated with computerised perimetry. A post-study analysis was performed including all available data, thus extending maximum follow-up to 17 years. Results: After 5 years of follow-up eight patients in the placebo group and five patients in the timolol group had developed glaucomatous field loss (NS); the corresponding figures after 10 years were 15 patients in the placebo group and seven patients in the timolol group. Survival analysis showed a tendency but no statistically significant difference between treatment groups (P=0.07). Study attrition was large. Eighteen patients in each group had developed glaucomatous field loss when also post-study data were included. IOP reduction was greater in eyes passing the 10-year visit without field loss (5.7 mmHg), than in those that reached an endpoint (2.3 mmHg; P=0.0002). Conclusion: In this long-term study we found a tendency but failed to prove a beneficial effect of topical timolol treatment in patients with elevated IOP, normal visual fields and some additional risk factor. The intent-to-treat analysis showed no difference between treatment groups. The high attrition shows the difficulties associated with very long follow-up."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of short-term supplementation of EGCG on inner retinal function in ocular hypertension (OHT) and open-angle glaucoma (OAG). Methods: Eighteen OHT and 18 OAG patients (perimetric mean deviation: >-10 dB) were randomly assigned to assume oral placebo or EGCG over a 3-month period in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00476138). Pattern-evoked electroretinograms (PERGs) to 1.6 cycles/ degree square-wave gratings, counterphased at 16 reversals/second, and standard automated perimetry (Humphrey 30-2) were assessed at the study entry (baseline), and after 3 months of placebo or EGCG. Results: After EGCG, PERGs of OAG, but not OHT patients were increased in amplitude, compared either to baseline values (mean amplitude change: 0.06 log muV, p<0.05) or to PERG amplitude values found in the same patients after placebo administration (mean change: -0.02 log muV, p not significant; difference between EGCG and placebo: 0.08 log muV, p<0.05). In both OHT and OAG patients, standard automated perimetry did not show significant changes after either EGCG or placebo. In individual OAG patients, the magnitude of PERG amplitude increment after EGCG was inversely related (r=-0.8, plt;0.01) to corresponding baseline amplitudes. Conclusions: Although this study cannot provide evidence for long-term benefit of EGCG supplementation in OAG, and the observed effect is small, the results suggest that EGCG might favourably influence inner retinal function in eyes with early to moderately advanced glaucomatous damage. copyright Springer-Verlag 2009."

Methods: In a randomised prospective controlled study of an exploratory nature, 18 subjects with ocular hypertension had pilocarpine 2% eye drops instilled into a randomly chosen eye three times at 10 min intervals. Physiological saline was instilled into the contralateral control eye. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and pulsatile ocular blood flow (POBF) measurements were taken before the first application and 90 min after the last application using the OBF tonometer (OBF Laboratory, Wilts, UK). Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: Of the 18 patients who entered the trial, 2 were suggested by the OBF system software as having 'poorly reliable' data. The analysis was made on the remaining 16. There was a significant reduction in IOP at 90 min for the treated eye in comparison with the contralateral control eye (p=0.001; median difference -4.25 mmHg; 95% confidence interval, -5.85 to -2.40).

During the five-year follow-up period, visual field loss developed in 10 placebo-treated eyes and four of the eyes treated with timolol. Progressive cupping was detected in eight eyes treated with placebo and four eyes with timolol. In addition, a significantly greater increase in optic disk pallor was noted in placebo-treated eyes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Multicenter, prospective, randomized, investigator-masked trial of 94 black patients previously diagnosed with OAG or OHT. All patients completed washout of ocular hypotensive medications before study participation. Patients were assigned to either once-daily bimatoprost 0.03% or once-daily travoprost 0.004% for 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were mean intraocular pressure (IOP), mean change from baseline IOP, and percentage of patients who reached a target IOP reduction. Secondary measures included ophthalmologic examination and adverse events. RESULTS: Both bimatoprost and travoprost significantly lowered IOP at all study visits (p < 0.001). Bimatoprost provided mean IOP reductions from baseline that ranged from 6.8 mmHg to 7.8 mmHg (27% to 31%). Travoprost provided mean IOP reductions from baseline that ranged from 6.2 mmHg to 6.9 mmHg (25% to 28%). By month 3, 85% of participants in the bimatoprost group had a mean IOP reduction of at least 20%, compared with 68% of those in the travoprost group. Furthermore, 31.9% of those in the bimatoprost group had a mean IOP reduction of more than 40% at month 3 compared with 20.9% of those in the travoprost group. There were no significant differences in biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, or visual acuity. Ocular redness was the most commonly reported adverse event in both treatment groups.

Dorzolamide and corneal recovery from edema in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension	American Journal of Ophthalmology	Am.J.Ophthalmol.	2000	129	2	144	150	"PURPOSE: To investigate whether dorzolamide alters corneal hydration control in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. METHODS: Pachymetry, tonometry, and endothelial cell density were measured by a masked observer in 19 subjects with bilateral glaucoma or ocular hypertension. They were treated with 2% dorzolamide in one eye, and with saline in the other, before wearing contact lenses under patched eyes. Corneal thickness, measured each 30 minutes up to 4.5 hours after contact lens removal, enabled estimation of percentage recovery per hour and time for 95% of corneal thickness recovery for both eyes. Seven patients repeated this test after 1 year of dorzolamide use, and their results were compared with those of the preceding year. RESULTS: After induction of hypoxic corneal edema, there was no significant difference between paired corneas in swelling levels (60.0+/-11.8 and 59.8+/-12.9 microm) (P = .94), time to 95% recovery (440.6+/-255.8 and 445.4+/-186.7 minutes) (P = .93), and percentage recovery per hour (38.1%+/-10.9% and 36.1%+/-9.6%) (P = .40). Subjects followed up after 1 year of dorzolamide use did not differ significantly in values of endothelial cell density, percentage recovery per hour, or time to 95% recovery from those obtained a year before. One subject developed persistent corneal edema after his stress test in the eye treated with dorzolamide. CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference in the recovery from induced corneal edema after either a short-term or 1-year use of dorzolamide in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension with a normal corneal endothelium. One patient had persistent corneal edema after the stress test was performed on the dorzolamide-treated eye."

METHODS: This was a prospective, double-masked, randomized, controlled, cross-over evaluation. After a 6-week wash-out period, the patients then returned for baseline diurnal curve testing every 2 h (8 AM to 8 PM). Patients with an IOP of 22-29 mmHg inclusive at 8 AMwere randomized to either bimatoprost dosed each evening or DTFC twice-daily. Patients returned in 8 weeks for the Period 1 diurnal curve and were switched to the opposite treatment. Patients again returned in 8 weeks for the Period 2 diurnal curve. RESULTS: Of the 29 patients, mean untreated baseline IOP (visit 2) was 24.6 +/- 2.6 mmHg and treatment mean IOP was statistically lower with bimatoprost 17.6 +/- 2.0 mmHg than for DTFC 18.8 +/- 2.5 mmHg (P = 0.03), as was the IOP range (P = 0.02) and IOP peak (P = 0.003). No significant differences were found between DTFC and bimatoprost at individual time points after a modified Bonferroni correction (>0.02). DTFC demonstrated a greater incidence of stinging or burning (n = 12) than bimatoprost (n = 0; P = < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that OAG patients generally can obtain similar IOP control at individual time points (when a Bonferroni correction is considered) by switching to either DTFC or bimatoprost, but overall diurnal control is statistically better with bimatoprost.

Brimonidine tartrate: a one-month dose response study.[See comment][erratum appears in ophthalmology 1997 mar;104(3):346]	Ophthalmology	Ophthalmology	1997	104	1	131	136	"BACKGROUND: Brimonidine tartrate is a relatively selective alpha2-agonist that effectively reduces mean intraocular pressure (IOP) and the incidence of IOP spikes after laser trabeculoplasty. The authors were interested in evaluating the dose response of brimonidine when applied topically for a longer duration in patients with elevated IOPs. METHODS: The authors conducted a 1-month, multicentered, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel clinical study in 194 patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma (mean IOP, 25.6 +/- 3.2 mmHg). The authors administered three concentrations of brimonidine (0.08%, 0.2%, and 0.5%) or placebo bilaterally every 12 hours for 1 month. The authors evaluated the following parameters: IOP, heart rate, blood pressure, visual acuity, pupil size, basal tear secretion as well as patient comfort at baseline, day 1, week 1, week 3, and week 4. RESULTS: All concentrations of brimonidine significantly reduced IOP, compared to baseline and placebo, at all follow-up visits. Maximum mean IOP decreases from baseline of 20.8%, 27.2%, and 30.1% were observed for the 0.08%, 0.20%, and 0.5% treatment groups, respectively. On days 1 and 21, the 0.2% and 0.5% treatment groups exhibited significantly greater IOP decreases than did the 0.08% group. After the initial steep decline in IOP, the effect decreased slightly and stabilized at day 14 at the level that was maintained throughout the study. The most frequent side effects reported were fatigue and dry mouth. No significant changes in heart rate were reported. Statistically significant decreases in mean blood pressure without clinical symptoms were observed within the 0.2% and 0.5% treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Brimonidine 0.2% is well tolerated, efficacious, and shows potential as an agent in the long-term treatment of elevated IOP.

METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, active controlled, parallel group study was conducted multinationally at 31 sites, in 241 patients as above, with assessments at baseline and monthly during 3 months of treatment. The primary end point was a diurnal reduction of trough/peak intraocular pressure from a timolol 0.5% twice daily baseline. RESULTS: Both treatment regimens reduced intraocular pressure significantly at all time points (P <.001): brinzolamide plus timolol by -3.6 to -5.3 mm Hg (-14.2 to -21.9%), dorzolamide plus timolol by -3.6 mm Hg to -5.1 mm Hg (-14.1 to -21.2%). Clinically relevant intraocular pressure reductions (decreases 5 mm Hg or greater or absolute intraocular pressure values 21 mm Hg or less) were manifested by 50.0% to 89.3% of patients under brinzolamide plus timolol and by 43.9% to 85.4% under dorzolamide plus timolol. The treatments were equivalent in mean intraocular pressure-lowering. In general, both regimens were well tolerated. However, more patients (P =.001) experienced at least one adverse event with dorzolamide plus timolol (32.8%) as compared with brinzolamide plus timolol (14.7%); also, more patients (P =.001) experienced ocular discomfort (stinging and burning) after dorzolamide plus timolol (13.1%) than after brinzolamide plus timolol (1.7%). CONCLUSIONS: In terms of intraocular pressure reduction, brinzolamide 1% twice daily was equivalent to dorzolamide 2% twice daily, each added to timolol 0.5% twice daily, but brinzolamide produced significantly less ocular burning and stinging.

A beta blocker (0.5% timolol) and a novel prostaglandin F(2alpha) metabolite related drug (0.12% unoprostone) were examined in a prospective, randomised fashion. METHODS: 40 patients were randomly assigned to use either 0. 5% timolol (timolol group) or 0.12% unoprostone eyedrops (unoprostone group) twice a day for 24 weeks. In addition to routine ocular examinations, corneal epithelial integrity (vital staining tests, tear film break up time (BUT), anterior fluorometry, specular microscopy) and tear function (Schirmer's test, cotton thread test, tear clearance test (TCT)) were examined before and after the treatment. RESULTS: Both eyedrops caused significant reduction in intraocular pressure from the baseline levels. No significant changes were noted in corneal integrity in both groups, except a decrease in BUT at 20 weeks in the timolol group. The timolol group demonstrated significant decreases in Schirmer's test, tear clearance test, and tear function index (Schirmer's test value multiplied by clearance test); however, no such changes were noted in the unoprostone group. CONCLUSION: While unoprostone eyedrops caused no adverse effects on the corneal epithelial integrity and tear function, timolol caused significant impairments in tear production and turnover."

Design: Randomized, controlled, investigator-masked, single-site, parallel-group clinical trial. Participants: One hundred twenty eyes of 120 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who had inadequate IOP control after at least 6 weeks of monotherapy with a once-daily PGA (bimatoprost, latanoprost, or travoprost). Intervention: Study eyes were assigned randomly to adjunctive treatment with thrice-daily brimonidine tartrate 0.15% (n = 41), dorzolamide hydrochloride 2% (n = 40), or brinzolamide 1% (n = 39) for 4 months. Main Outcome Measures: Efficacy was evaluated by IOP measured at 10 am and 4 pm at baseline, month 1, and month 4. Results: The mean IOP at each hour at PGA-treated baseline was comparable among treatment groups. After initiation of adjunctive therapy, the mean IOP was lower and the mean change from baseline IOP was greater in the brimonidine group than in either the dorzolamide group or the brinzolamide group at 10 am and 4 pm at months 1 and 4 (P<0.001). After 4 months of adjunctive treatment, the mean IOP reduction from baseline at 10 am and 4 pm was 4.8 mmHg (21%) and 3.8 mmHg (19%) with brimonidine, 3.4 mmHg (16%) and 2.8 mmHg (14%) with dorzolamide, and 3.4 mmHg (16%) and 2.6 mmHg (13%) with brinzolamide (P<0.001 for brimonidine vs. dorzolamide and brinzolamide at each time point). Each of the study drugs was well tolerated, and all patients completed the study. Conclusions: The addition of brimonidine to a PGA provided greater IOP lowering than the addition of either dorzolamide or brinzolamide. Further studies are needed to evaluate the relative long-term efficacy and tolerability of these medications as adjunctive therapy to a PGA.

Efficacy of twice-daily levobunolol in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure	Canadian journal of ophthalmology.Journal canadien d'ophtalmologie	 	1988	23	4	168	170	The efficacy of twice-daily treatment with 0.5% levobunolol hydrochloride was compared with that of 0.5% timolol maleate in 27 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in a double-blind randomized trial. At all follow-up visits the patients in both groups had significantly decreased intraocular pressure (p less than 0.05); there was no significant difference between the groups. Levobunolol produced significant decreases in mean heart rate (p less than 0.05). One patient with an undisclosed history of childhood asthma experienced bronchospasm related to an acute upper respiratory tract infection while receiving levobunolol. Neither drug caused any significant ocular problems. The results show a clear ocular hypotensive effect with twice-daily 0.5% levobunolol.

Intraocular pressure fluctuations in response to the water-drinking provocative test in patients using latanoprost versus unoprostone	Journal of Ocular Pharmacology & Therapeutics	 	2004	20	5	401	410	"Impairment of outflow facility in glaucoma causes large intraocular pressure (IOP) fluctuations that have been shown to be a risk factor for disease progression. The water-drinking provocative test (WDT) has been proposed as an indirect measurement of outflow facility to compare intraocular pressure responses of glaucoma eyes to different drugs. This study was a double-masked, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial comparing the IOP fluctuations in response to the WDT in patients using latanoprost versus unoprostone. After completing a wash-out of ocular hypotensive medications, patients with primary openangle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive either latanoprost (N=40) or unoprostone (N=42). IOP was measured before treatment and at 8 weeks after treatment (baseline IOP for WDT), followed by the WDT. IOP fluctuations and maximum IOP after water ingestion were compared between the two groups. Analysis of covariance was used to adjust for the effects of baseline IOP and treatment efficacy. The mean percentage reduction of IOP was 27% in patients using latanoprost, as compared to 13% in patients using unoprostone (p<0.001). Patients on treatment with latanoprost had significantly less IOP fluctuations in response to the WDT, compared to patients using unoprostone. From an overall baseline IOP of 20.0 mmHg and an overall treatment efficacy of 20%, the mean+/-standard error of the mean (SEM) of the IOP fluctuation during the WDT was 5.3+/-0.4 mmHg in the unoprostone group, and 3.6+/-0.4 mmHg in the latanoprost group (p=0.005, ANCOVA). This could represent an additional benefit of latanoprost over unoprostone in controlling the intraocular pressure of glaucomatous patients.

METHODS: Twenty four patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension were randomised into two groups. Twelve patients (group 1) were given latanoprost 0.005% once daily for 4 weeks and then latanoprost 0.001% once daily for the following 4 weeks. Twelve patients (group 2) were given latanoprost 0.001% once daily for 4 weeks and then latanoprost 0.005% for the following 4 weeks. RESULTS: There was a significant IOP reduction from baseline in both groups on day 28 as well as on day 56. When the results from both groups were used for calculations, the mean IOP reduction from baseline after 4 weeks of treatment with latanoprost 0.005% (day 28 or 56) was 9.6 (SD 3.3) mm Hg (35.0%). After 4 weeks of treatment with latanoprost 0.001%, the IOP reduction (day 28 or 56) was 7.6 (3.4) mm Hg (27.7%). The difference in IOP reduction between the two concentrations was 2.0 (2.3) mm Hg (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Latanoprost 0.005% was more effective than latanoprost 0.001% in reducing IOP. Even the lower concentration was surprisingly effective, and potentially may be of importance for use in clinical practice. Furthermore, it is at present unknown whether the increase in iris pigmentation seen in certain patients treated with latanoprost 0.005% is dose dependent and might be less pronounced with latanoprost 0.001%. Long term studies with a larger number of patients are required in order to answer this question. CAS Registry/EC Number/Name of Substance 0 (Prostaglandins F, Synthetic). 130209-82-4 (latanoprost)."

Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 2 prostaglandin analogues, travoprost eye drops and latanoprost eye drops, on intraocular pressure (IOP) and pulsatile ocular blood flow (pOBF) in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Methods: Previously untreated patients aged 40 to 60 years with POAG and normal brachial blood pressure (BBP), heart rate, body mass index, and hemorheologic findings were eligible for this randomized, double-masked study. Two drops of travoprost (group T) or latanoprost (group L) were self-administered in both eyes at 9:00 PM. In all patients, IOP, pOBF, BBP, and heart rate were measured at baseline and on days 15, 30, 60, 90, and 180 of treatment. Results: Twenty-five consecutive patients with POAG were enrolled in this study conducted at the Glaucoma Research Center of the Department of Ophthalmology, Bari University, Policlinico di Bari (Bari, Italy). Of these, 7 were withdrawn because they did not return for the second appointment, leaving 18 patients (11 men, 7 women; mean [SD] age, 51.9 [5.5] years) to complete the study. In both groups, mean IOP values were significantly reduced at all time points compared with baseline (all P < 0.01). Mean pOBF values increased ~50% from baseline following treatment with either travoprost or latanoprost by day 15, were maintained at that level for 60 days, and then gradually decreased (group T: P = NS, NS, <0.01, <0.05, and <0.05 at days 15, 30, 60, 90, and 180, respectively, vs baseline; group L: P < 0.01 at all time points vs baseline). All other parameters remained constant throughout the study. An early inverse correlation between IOP and pOBF was noted in group T but not in group L. No significant differences were found between groups in IOP or pOBF at any time point. Conclusions: In this study population, pOBF was increased with travoprost and latanoprost in the short term, but this effect was kept constant only with travoprost, IOP was reduced with both drugs after short-term therapy, and this reduction was maintained in both groups. Travoprost may represent another option for the medical treatment of POAG. Copyright Œ© 2009 Elsevier B. V., Amsterdam. All Rights Reserved."
